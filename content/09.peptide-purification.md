### Peptide fractionation methods
Peptide fractionation is a very important step in the MS-based proteomics sample process as it helps increase proteome coverage. 
The characterization of the whole proteome is expected from higher order organisms, and with rising interest in post-translational modifications, an elaborate coverage of protein sequence is required. 
There are different methods for peptide fractionation as follows:

#### Ion-exchange chromatography (IEC)
This method involves the separation based on contrasting electric charge [@PMID:27868236]. 
In this approach, the mechanism of analyte retention is based on the principle of electrostatic attraction between the sample and the stationary phase functional groups (FGs), having opposite charges. 
IEC is classified into two types: cation-exchange and anion-exchange chromatography. 
In cation-exchange chromatography, at an acidic pH, the negatively charged functional groups such as sulfates are attracted to positively charged peptides, whereas, in anion-exchange chromatography, positively charged FGs such as quaternary ammoniums are attracted to peptides with negative charge at an alkaline pH. 
These techniques are further classified into: strong (cation [SCX] and anion [SAX] exchange), and weak exchangers (cation [WCX] and anion [WAX] exchange), based on the type of FG attached [@PMID:35777803]. 
These functional groups are most commonly supported in resins made up of silica and synthetic polymers, however, some inorganic materials are sometimes used [@PMID:27868236]. 
In the IEC method, peptide elution is performed using a mobile phase with higher ionic strength, to ensure peptide partition into the liquid phase. SCX along with a salt gradient/plug is a routinely used proteomics technique. 
In the SCX method, peptides are resolved according to their net charge, in which the peptide with the lowest positive charge is eluted first. 
Increasing the salt concentration decreases the peptide retention time due to competition with the electrostatic interactions between the peptides and the solid phase. 
However, SCX resolution is limited compared to reversed phase chromatography and will thus limit the suitability of this technique for complex mixtures [@PMID:15672457].

#### Reversed-phase chromatography (RPLC)
Reversed-phase chromatography is the most widely commonly used chromatographic technique which separates molecules in solution having neutral pH based on their hydrophobicity. 
The separation occurs on the basis of the partition coefficient of analytes between the mobile phase and the hydrophobic stationary phase. 
Highly polar peptides elute before the ones having less polarity because of the strong interaction with the hydrophobic functional groups forming a layer similar to a liquid around the silica resin [@PMID:20973639]. 
RPLC has been widely used in separation of peptides because of its compatibility with gradient elution and aqueous samples and its retention mechanism, which modulates separation owing to changes in the properties like pH, additives and organic modifier [@PMID:20031138]. 
Numerous factors influence the capacity of chromatographic peaks, such as temperature, column length, stationary phase, particle size, mobile-phase ion-pairing reagent, mobile-phase modifier and gradient slope[@PMID:16224963]. 
Usually online RPLC is done at acidic pH to ensure peptide ionization, but it can be paired with offline high pH RPLC and multiple fraction concatenation to produce orthogonal separation due to altered ionization of amino acids changing peptide hydrophobicity [@PMID:22462785].

#### Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)
HILIC is similar in its principle to normal-phase chromatography. 
It is used for the separation of hydrophilic peptides and polar analytes [@PMID:21879300]. 
This separation is achieved by a stationary phase that is hydrophilic in nature, for example: cyano-, diol-, amino- bonded phases [@PMID:18428181], and an organic and hydrophobic mobile phase [@PMID:18264818]. 
The elution of bonded peptides occurs by increasing the mobile phase polarity in a reversed elution order as compared to RPLC [@PMID:18264818; 15459207]. 
Thus, the peptides with less polarity elute before the more polar peptides. 
HILIC can also be used for enrichment and targeted proteomic analysis of PTMs, such as glycosylation, N-acetylation and phosphorylation, which increase the polarity of peptides and therefore also their retention on HILIC [@PMID:20973639].

#### Isoelectric focusing (IEF)
IEF is a type of high-resolution (HR) technique of electrophoresis used for the separation as well as concentration of peptides that are amphoteric in nature on the basis of their isoelectric point (pI) using a solution without buffer consisting of either carrier ampholytes or a gel with immobilized pH gradient (IPG). 
After IEF separation, the separated amphoteric peptides in the liquid phase are recovered for further analysis by RPLC-MS/MS [@PMID:16849286]. 
Along with being a technique with improved resolution and capacity, for separation of peptides, IEF provides with additional information on physicochemical properties of the peptides, for example: peptide iso electric point (pI) which acts as a tool for validation and filtration for identifying MS/MS peptide sequence during the step of database search [@PMID:18851748]. 
The IEF system is not only used for increasing the coverage of proteome but also in quantitative label-free [@PMID:17708596] and stable isobaric labeling experiments [@PMID:18851748]. 
IEF and gel-based separations have fallen out of favor in the last decade due to improvements in liquid chromatography. 

#### Electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC)
ERLIC is a method based on use of a weak anion exchange column operated at low pH with high organic solvent enabling isocratic elution [@DOI:10.1021/ac070997p]. 
Acidic peptides are retained by electrostatic interaction, basic and neutral peptides are retained through hydrophilic interaction made favorable by high organic solvent. 
This improves retention of acidic peptides and reduces retention of basic peptides compared to normal HILIC [@DOI:10.1021/pr100037h].
