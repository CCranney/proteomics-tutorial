## Peptide or Protein Enrichment

### Protein enrichment (e.g. for protein protein interactions)
* coIP
* APEX
* bioID
* bioplex


### Peptide enrichment 
* antibody enrichments of modifications, e.g. lysine acetylation [@DOI:10.1002/pmic.201800123].
* TiO2 and Fe enrichment of phosphorylation
* Glycosylation
* SISCAPA

### Abundant protein depletion (Blood samples)
The range abundances of proteins in the blood/plasma proteome exceeds 10 orders of magnitude. 
Due to this wide dynamic range, detection of proteins with medium and low abundance by proteomic analyses is difficult [@PMID:20677825]. 
Identifying protein biomarkers from biological samples such as blood is often obstructed by proteins present at higher concentrations. 
The removal of these high abundant proteins enables the detection of less abundant and unique proteins. 
The ability to deplete abundant proteins with specificity, reproducibility, and selectivity is extremely important in proteomic studies [@PMID:16052628].

The following are some of the methods used for abundant protein depletion:

#### Dye-ligand depletion: 
This method is used for the depletion of serum albumin based on the interaction between albumin and dyes like Cibacron Blue (CB) through electrostatic force, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. 
The method is relatively low cost, widely available, robust and has high binding capacity. 
However, it lacks specificity and has varying efficiency [@PMID:11694290; @PMID:24168355].

#### Protein-ligand depletion: 
This method is used for depletion of immunoglobulins (Ig) based on the interaction between the Fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of these Igs [@PMID:2473373] and cell wall protein A, G or A/G of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp [@PMID:2938951; @PMID:10805799]. 
It is highly selective and has high yield and purity. 
However, non-specific binding may occur due to co-absorption of other proteins [@PMID:31617391].

#### Immunodepletion: 
This method is used for depletion of proteins having high abundance in plasma or serum on the basis of the specific interaction of these proteins with their respective antibodies (antigen-antibody interaction) [@PMID:27896769]. 
It has high specificity and commercial kits are also readily available, but it is expensive, has limited sample loading and can result in non-specific binding [@PMID:31617391].

#### Combinatorial peptide ligand library: 
This method is used for partial depletion of major proteins i.e., those with high abundance and for relative enrichment of lower and medium abundant proteins [@PMID:18451796]. 
It is based on the interaction with an array of ligands which are essentially peptides of 6 amino acids in length. 
It is also used for normalization of the global protein abundance [@PMID:25384740]. 
However, the drawbacks include non-specific binding as well as loss of proteins due to incomplete elution or inefficient binding [@PMID:31617391].

#### Precipitation: 
This method of abundant protein depletion works by altering the solubility of proteins using a chemical reagent including inorganic salt solution [@PMID:21963274], organic solvents [@PMID:25083595], non-ionic polymer [@PMID:27832179] and reducing agents [@PMID:19454248]. 
It is extremely simple and cost-effective. 
However, it is less specific with a risk of protein loss, difficulty in protein resolubilization as well as time consuming [@PMID:31617391].

#### New technologies: 
Newer methods of highly abundant protein depletion are based on the interaction between polymers such as bacterial cellulose nanofibers [@PMID:30219335], cryogels [@PMID:30999704; @PMID:23668981] and nanomaterials [@DOI:10.1016/j.procbio.2010.07.007]. 
These techniques are highly specific, relatively cheap, and very stable. 
They can also be reused since they have larger binding capacity and less cross-reactivity [@PMID:31617391].
