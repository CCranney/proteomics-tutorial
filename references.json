    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.",

    "abstract": "Studies on gastric digestion during 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the agent which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes the dissolution of nutrients such as meat or coagulated egg white. Soon afterward it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to diffusible products named peptones. Efforts to isolate and purify pepsin were spurred by its widespread adoption for the treatment of digestive disorders, and highly active preparations were available by the end of the nineteenth century. There was uncertainty, however, as to the chemical nature of pepsin, for some preparations exhibited the properties of proteins while other preparations failed to do so. The question was not settled until after 1930, when Northrop crystallized swine pepsin and provided convincing evidence for its identity as a protein. The availability of this purified pepsin during the 1930s also led to the discovery of the first synthetic peptide substrates for pepsin, thus providing needed evidence for the peptide structure of native proteins, a matter of debate at that time. After 1945, with the introduction of new separation methods, notably chromatography and electrophoresis, and the availability of specific proteinases, the amino acid sequences of many proteins, including pepsin and its precursor pepsinogen, were determined. Moreover, treatment of pepsin with chemical reagents indicated the participation in the catalytic mechanism of two aspartyl units widely separated in the linear sequence. Studies on the kinetics of pepsin action on long chain synthetic peptides suggested that the catalytic site was an extended structure. Similar properties were found for other \"aspartyl proteinases,\" such as chymosin (used in cheese making), some intracellular proteinases (cathepsins), and plant proteinases. After 1975, the three-dimensional structures of pepsin and many of its relatives were determined by means of x-ray diffraction techniques, greatly extending our insight into the mechanism of the catalytic action of these enzymes. That knowledge has led to the design of new inhibitors of aspartyl proteinases, which are participants in the maturation of human immunodeficiency virus and in the generation of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The determination of disulfide bonds is an important aspect of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the chemical structure of a protein. The basic strategy for obtaining this information involves the identification of disulfide-linked peptides in digests of proteins and the characterization of their half-cystinyl peptide constituents. Tools for disulfide bond analysis have improved dramatically in the past two decades, especially in terms of speed and sensitivity. This improvement is largely due to the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), and complementary analyzers with high resolution and accuracy. The process of pairing half-cystinyl peptides is now generally achieved by comparing masses of non-reduced and reduced aliquots of a digest of a protein that was proteolyzed with intact disulfide bonds. Pepsin has favorable properties for generating disulfide-linked peptides, including its acidic pH optimum, at which disulfide bond rearrangement is precluded and protein conformations are likely to be unfolded and accessible to cleavage, and broad substrate specificity. These properties potentiate cleavage between all half-cystine residues of the substrate protein. However, pepsin produces complex digests that contain overlapping peptides due to ragged cleavage. This complexity can produce very complex spectra and/or hamper the ionization of some constituent peptides. It may also be more difficult to compute which half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest are disulfide-linked in non-reduced peptic digests. This ambiguity is offset to some extent by sequence tags that may arise from ragged cleavages and aid sequence assignments. Problems associated with pepsin cleavage can be minimized by digestion in solvents that contain 50% H(2) (18)O. Resultant disulfide-linked peptides have distinct isotope profiles (combinations of isotope ratios and average mass increases) compared to the same peptides with only (16)O in their terminal carboxylates. Thus, it is possible to identify disulfide-linked peptides in digests and chromatographic fractions, using these mass-specific markers, and to rationalize mass changes upon reduction in terms of half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest. Some peptides may require additional cleavages due to their multiple disulfide bond contents and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine linkages. Interpretation of the MS/MS spectra of peptides with multiple disulfides in supplementary digests is also facilitated by the presence of (18)O in their terminal carboxylates.",

The enzymes used were trypsin, Lys-C, and Asp-N, which cleave at arginine and lysine residues, lysine, and aspartic acid residues, respectively. This approach was evaluated with the glycoprotein, tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA and gave enhanced sequence coverage, compared with a single enzymatic digest. The approach was then evaluated with a complex proteomic sample, namely plasma. It was found that trypsin and Lys-C were able to detect overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and a digital recombination of the data gave a significant increase in both the number of protein identifications as well as an increase in the number of peptides identified per protein (which improves the certainty of the assignment).",

    "abstract": "Proteomic analysis typically has been performed using proteins digested with trypsin because of the excellent fragmentation patterns they produce in collision induced dissociation (CID). For analyses in which high protein coverage is desirable, such as global monitoring of post-translational modifications, additional sequences can be seen using parallel digestion with a second enzyme. We have benchmarked a relatively obscure basidomycete-derived zinc metalloendopeptidase, Lys-N, that selectively cleaves the amide bond N-terminal of lysine residues. We have found that Lys-N digestion yields peptides with easily assigned CID spectra. Using a mixture of purified proteins as well as a complex yeast lysate, we have shown that Lys-N efficiently digests all proteins at the predicted sites of cleavage. Shotgun proteomics analyses of Lys-N digests of both the standard mixture and yeast lysate yielded peptide and protein identification numbers that were generally comparable to trypsin digestion, whereas the combination data from Lys-N and trypsin digestion substantially enhanced protein coverage. During CID fragmentation, the additional amino terminal basicity enhanced b-ion intensity which was reflected in long b-ion tags that were particularly pronounced during CID in a quadrupole. Finally, immonium ion peaks produced from Lys-N digested peptides originate from the carboxy terminus in contrast to tryptic peptides where immonium ions originate from the amino terminus.",

The composition, optical activity, and proteolytic activity of this protein remain constant through seven successive crystallizations. No evidence for the presence of a mixture or of a solid solution is found in a study of the solubility of the protein in a series of different salt solutions, nor from the diffusion coefficient or from the rate of inactivation. These results indicate that the material is a pure substance or possibly a solid solution of two or more substances having nearly the same solubility in all the various solvents studied. It seems reasonable to conclude from these experiments that the possibility of a mixture must be limited to a mixture of proteins, so that the conclusion seems justified that pepsin itself is a protein.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale protein sequencing methods rely on enzymatic digestion of complex protein mixtures to generate a collection of peptides for mass spectrometric analysis. Here we examine the use of multiple proteases (trypsin, LysC, ArgC, AspN, and GluC) to improve both protein identification and characterization in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a data-dependent, decision tree-based algorithm to tailor MS(2) fragmentation method to peptide precursor, we identified 92 095 unique peptides (609 665 total) mapping to 3908 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). These results were a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest (trypsin) - 27 822 unique peptides corresponding to 3313 proteins. The additional 595 protein identifications were mainly from those at low abundances (i.e., < 1000 copies/cell); sequence coverage for these proteins was likewise improved nearly 3-fold. We demonstrate that large portions of the proteome are simply inaccessible following digestion with a single protease and that multiple proteases, rather than technical replicates, provide a direct route to increase both protein identifications and proteome sequence coverage.",

    "abstract": "The complete and specific proteolytic cleavage of protein samples into peptides is crucial for the success of every shotgun LC-MS/MS experiment. In particular, popular peptide-based label-free and targeted mass spectrometry approaches rely on efficient generation of fully cleaved peptides to ensure accurate and sensitive protein quantification. In contrast to previous studies, we globally and quantitatively assessed the efficiency of different digestion strategies using a yeast cell lysate, label-free quantification, and statistical analysis. Digestion conditions include double tryptic, surfactant-assisted, and tandem-combinatorial Lys-C/trypsin digestion. In comparison to tryptic digests, Lys-C/trypsin digests were found most efficient to yield fully cleaved peptides while reducing the abundance of miscleaved peptides. Subsequent sequence context analysis revealed improved digestion performances of Lys-C/trypsin for miscleaved sequence stretches flanked by charged basic and particulary acidic residues. Furthermore, targeted MS analysis demonstrated a more comprehensive protein cleavage only after Lys-C/trypsin digestion, resulting in a more accurrate absolute protein quantification and extending the number of peptides suitable for SRM assay development. Therefore, we conclude that a serial Lys-C/trypsin digestion is highly attractive for most applications in quantitative MS-based proteomics building on in-solution digestion schemes.",

    "abstract": "A method to correlate the uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of peptides produced under low energy (10-50 eV) collision conditions with amino acid sequences in the Genpept database has been developed. In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of ±1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database. ",

    "abstract": "Quantitative and qualitative protein characteristics are regulated at genomic, transcriptomic, and posttranscriptional levels. Here, we integrated in-depth transcriptome and proteome analyses of liver tissues from two rat strains to unravel the interactions within and between these layers. We obtained peptide evidence for 26,463 rat liver proteins. We validated 1,195 gene predictions, 83 splice events, 126 proteins with nonsynonymous variants, and 20 isoforms with nonsynonymous RNA editing. Quantitative RNA sequencing and proteomics data correlate highly between strains but poorly among each other, indicating extensive nongenetic regulation. Our multilevel analysis identified a genomic variant in the promoter of the most differentially expressed gene Cyp17a1, a previously reported top hit in genome-wide association studies for human hypertension, as a potential contributor to the hypertension phenotype in SHR rats. These results demonstrate the power of and need for integrative analysis for understanding genetic control of molecular dynamics and phenotypic diversity in a system-wide manner. ",

    "abstract": "Bottom-up proteomics largely relies on tryptic peptides for protein identification and quantification. Tryptic digestion often provides limited coverage of protein sequence because of issues such as peptide length, ionization efficiency, and post-translational modification colocalization. Unfortunately, a region of interest in a protein, for example, because of proximity to an active site or the presence of important post-translational modifications, may not be covered by tryptic peptides. Detection limits, quantification accuracy, and isoform differentiation can also be improved with greater sequence coverage. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) would also greatly benefit from being able to identify additional targetable sequences. In an attempt to improve protein sequence coverage and to target regions of proteins that do not generate useful tryptic peptides, we deployed a multiprotease strategy on the HeLa proteome. First, we used seven commercially available enzymes in single, double, and triple enzyme combinations. A total of 48 digests were performed. 5223 proteins were detected by analyzing the unfractionated cell lysate digest directly; with 42% mean sequence coverage. Additional strong-anion exchange fractionation of the most complementary digests permitted identification of over 3000 more proteins, with improved mean sequence coverage. We then constructed a web application (https://proteomics.swmed.edu/confetti) that allows the community to examine a target protein or protein isoform in order to discover the enzyme or combination of enzymes that would yield peptides spanning a certain region of interest in the sequence. Finally, we examined the use of nontryptic digests for SRM. From our strong-anion exchange fractionation data, we were able to identify three or more proteotypic SRM candidates within a single digest for 6056 genes. Surprisingly, in 25% of these cases the digest producing the most observable proteotypic peptides was neither trypsin nor Lys-C. SRM analysis of Asp-N versus tryptic peptides for eight proteins determined that Asp-N yielded higher signal in five of eight cases. ",

Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human proteome and a public, high-performance, in-memory database for real-time analysis of terabytes of big data, called ProteomicsDB. The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight and fosters the development of proteomic technology. ",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond identification is important for a detailed understanding of protein structures, which directly affect their biological functions. Here we describe an integrated workflow for the fast and accurate identification of authentic protein disulfide bridges. This novel workflow incorporates acidic proteolytic digestion using pepsin to eliminate undesirable disulfide reshuffling during sample preparation and a novel search engine, SlinkS, to directly identify disulfide-bridged peptides isolated via electron transfer higher energy dissociation (EThcD). In EThcD fragmentation of disulfide-bridged peptides, electron transfer dissociation preferentially leads to the cleavage of the S-S bonds, generating two intense disulfide-cleaved peptides as primary fragment ions. Subsequently, higher energy collision dissociation primarily targets unreacted and charge-reduced precursor ions, inducing peptide backbone fragmentation. SlinkS is able to provide the accurate monoisotopic precursor masses of the two disulfide-cleaved peptides and the sequence of each linked peptide by matching the remaining EThcD product ions against a linear peptide database. The workflow was validated using a protein mixture containing six proteins rich in natural disulfide bridges. Using this pepsin-based workflow, we were able to efficiently and confidently identify a total of 31 unique Cys-Cys bonds (out of 43 disulfide bridges present), with no disulfide reshuffling products detected. Pepsin digestion not only outperformed trypsin digestion in terms of the number of detected authentic Cys-Cys bonds, but, more important, prevented the formation of artificially reshuffled disulfide bridges due to protein digestion under neutral pH. Our new workflow therefore provides a precise and generic approach for disulfide bridge mapping, which can be used to study protein folding, structure, and stability. ",

The conversion of proteins into peptides in these so-called bottom-up approaches is nearly uniquely done by using trypsin as a proteolytic reagent. Here, we argue that our view of the proteome still remains incomplete and this is partially due to the nearly exclusive use of trypsin. Newly emerging alternative proteases and/or multi-protease protein digestion aim to increase proteome sequence coverage and improve the identification of post-translational modifications, through the analysis of complementary and often longer peptides, introducing an approach termed middle-down proteomics. Of pivotal importance for this purpose is the identification of proteases beneficial for use in proteomics. Here, we describe some of the shortcomings of the nearly exclusive use of trypsin in proteomics and review the properties of other proteomics-appropriate proteases. We describe favorable protease traits with an emphasis on middle-down proteomics and suggest potential sources for the discovery of new proteases. We also highlight a few examples wherein the use of other proteases than trypsin enabled the generation of more comprehensive data sets leading to previously unexplored knowledge of the proteome. ",

Surprisingly, we identified cleavage sites for this enzyme at the N-terminal side of several glutamyl residues in addition to the expected cleavage sites at aspartyl residues. The ability of this enzyme to cleave polypeptides at both glutamyl and aspartyl residues was confirmed by mapping additional sites on erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I.

    "abstract": "Common yet often overlooked, deamidation of peptidyl asparagine (Asn or N) generates aspartic acid (Asp or D) or isoaspartic acid (isoAsp or isoD). Being a spontaneous, non-enzymatic protein post-translational modification, deamidation artifact can be easily introduced during sample preparation, especially proteolysis where higher-order structures are removed. This artifact not only complicates the analysis of bona fide deamidation but also affects a wide range of chemical and enzymatic processes; for instance, the newly generated Asp and isoAsp residues may block or introduce new proteolytic sites, and also convert one Asn peptide into multiple species that affect quantification. While the neutral to mildly basic conditions for common proteolysis favor deamidation, mildly acidic conditions markedly slow down the process. Unlike other commonly used endoproteases, Glu-C remains active under mildly acid conditions. As such, as demonstrated herein, deamidation artifact during proteolysis was effectively eliminated by simply performing Glu-C digestion at pH 4.5 in ammonium acetate, a volatile buffer that is compatible with mass spectrometry. Moreover, nearly identical sequence specificity was observed at both pH's (8.0 for ammonium bicarbonate), rendering Glu-C as effective at pH 4.5. In summary, this method is generally applicable for protein analysis as it requires minimal sample preparation and uses the readily available Glu-C protease. ",

    "abstract": "Protein digestion using a dedicated protease represents a key element in a typical mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics experiment. Up to now, digestion has been predominantly performed with trypsin, mainly because of its high specificity, widespread availability and ease of use. Lately, it has become apparent that the sole use of trypsin in bottom-up proteomics may impose certain limits in our ability to grasp the full proteome, missing out particular sites of post-translational modifications, protein segments or even subsets of proteins. To overcome this problem, the proteomics community has begun to explore alternative proteases to complement trypsin. However, protocols, as well as expected results generated from these alternative proteases, have not been systematically documented. Therefore, here we provide an optimized protocol for six alternative proteases that have already shown promise in their applicability in proteomics, namely chymotrypsin, LysC, LysN, AspN, GluC and ArgC. This protocol is formulated to promote ease of use and robustness, which enable parallel digestion with each of the six tested proteases. We present data on protease availability and usage including recommendations for reagent preparation. We additionally describe the appropriate MS data analysis methods and the anticipated results in the case of the analysis of a single protein (BSA) and a more complex cellular lysate (Escherichia coli). The digestion protocol presented here is convenient and robust and can be completed in ∼2 d. ",

    "abstract": "Protein structural changes induced by external perturbations or internal cues can profoundly influence protein activity and thus modulate cellular physiology. A number of biophysical approaches are available to probe protein structural changes, but these are not applicable to a whole proteome in a biological extract. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a recently developed proteomics approach that enables the identification of protein structural changes directly in their complex biological context on a proteome-wide scale. After perturbations of interest, proteome extracts are subjected to a double-protease digestion step with a nonspecific protease applied under native conditions, followed by complete digestion with the sequence-specific protease trypsin under denaturing conditions. This sequential treatment generates structure-specific peptides amenable to bottom-up MS analysis. Next, a proteomics workflow involving shotgun or targeted MS and label-free quantification is applied to measure structure-dependent proteolytic patterns directly in the proteome extract. Possible applications of LiP-MS include discovery of perturbation-induced protein structural alterations, identification of drug targets, detection of disease-associated protein structural states, and analysis of protein aggregates directly in biological samples. The approach also enables identification of the specific protein regions involved in the structural transition or affected by the binding event. Sample preparation takes approximately 2 d, followed by one to several days of MS and data analysis time, depending on the number of samples analyzed. Scientists with basic biochemistry training can implement the sample preparation steps. MS measurement and data analysis require a background in proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification regulates numerous cellular processes. Unlike ubiquitin, detection of endogenous SUMOylated proteins is limited by the lack of naturally occurring protease sites in the C-terminal tail of SUMO proteins. Proteome-wide detection of SUMOylation sites on target proteins typically requires ectopic expression of mutant SUMOs with introduced tryptic sites. Here, we report a method for proteome-wide, site-level detection of endogenous SUMOylation that uses α-lytic protease, WaLP. WaLP digestion of SUMOylated proteins generates peptides containing SUMO-remnant diglycyl-lysine (KGG) at the site of SUMO modification. Using previously developed immuno-affinity isolation of KGG-containing peptides followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 1209 unique endogenous SUMO modification sites. We also demonstrate the impact of proteasome inhibition on ubiquitin and SUMO-modified proteomes using parallel quantitation of ubiquitylated and SUMOylated peptides. This methodological advancement enables determination of endogenous SUMOylated proteins under completely native conditions.",

In the present study, venom proteome profiling of a single Hypnale hypnale from Western Ghats of India was achieved using SDS-PAGE based protein separation followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. The identities of the proteins that were not established using the Mascot search were determined through de novo sequencing tools such as Novor followed by MS-BLAST based sequence similarity search algorithm and PEAKS proteomics software. The combined proteomics analysis revealed a total of 37 proteins belonging to nine different snake venom families, in which 7 proteins were exclusively identified through de novo strategies. The enzymatic and non-enzymatic venom protein families identified include serine proteases, metalloproteases, phospholipase A",

    "abstract": "Quantification of individual proteins is an essential task in understanding biological processes. For example, determination of concentrations of proteins transporting and metabolizing xenobiotics is a prerequisite for drug disposition predictions in humans based on in vitro data. So far, this task has frequently been accomplished by targeted proteomics. This type of analyses requires preparation of stable isotope labeled standards for each protein of interest. The selection of appropriate standard peptides is usually tedious and the number of proteins that can be studied in a single experiment by these approaches is limited. In addition, incomplete digestion of proteins often affects the accuracy of the quantification. To circumvent these constrains in proteomic protein quantification, label- and standard-free approaches, such as \"total protein approach\" (TPA) have been proposed. Here we directly compare an approach using stable isotope labeled (SIL) standards and TPA for quantification of transporters and enzymes in human liver samples within the same LC-MS/MS runs. We show that TPA is a convenient alternative to SIL-based methods. Optimization of the sample preparation beyond commonly used single tryptic digestion, by adding consecutive cleavage steps, improves accuracy and reproducibility of the TPA method to a level, which is achievable by analysis using stable isotope-labeled standard spiking.",

The nucleotide sequence contains an open reading frame which codes for the 198-residue mature enzyme and a potential prepro-peptide, also of 198 residues. The COOH-terminal 49 residues of the pro-peptide are significantly homologous to the propeptides of Streptomyces griseus proteases A and B. We suggest that this pro-peptide region facilitates formation of the active enzyme. A region bridging the NH2-terminal pre- and pro-peptides is homologous to a maize inhibitor of serine proteases. We speculate that this region inhibits enzymatic activity of the prepro-enzyme.",

    "abstract": "In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.",

Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation−maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.",
