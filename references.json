Despite intense research efforts to elucidate mechanisms of protein phosphorylation regulation, efficient, large-scale identification and characterization of phosphorylation sites remains an unsolved problem. In this report we describe an application of existing technology for the isolation and identification of phosphorylation sites. By using a strategy based on strong cation exchange chromatography, phosphopeptides were enriched from the nuclear fraction of HeLa cell lysate. From 967 proteins, 2,002 phosphorylation sites were determined by tandem MS. This unprecedented large collection of sites permitted a detailed accounting of known and unknown kinase motifs and substrates.</jats:p>",

Due to its flexible design, it supports analysis of label-free, data-dependent, data-independent and targeted proteomics datasets. protti can be run on the output of any search engine and software package commonly used for bottom-up proteomics experiments such as Spectronaut, Skyline, MaxQuant or Proteome Discoverer, adequately exported to table format.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>protti is implemented as an open-source R package. Release versions are available via CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=protti) and work on all major operating systems. The development version is maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/jpquast/protti). Full documentation including examples is provided in the form of vignettes on our package website (jpquast.github.io/protti/).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

There are more than 400 different types of PTMs affecting many aspects of protein functions. Such modifications happen as crucial molecular regulatory mechanisms to regulate diverse cellular processes. These processes have a significant impact on the structure and function of proteins. Disruption in PTMs can lead to the dysfunction of vital biological processes and hence to various diseases. High-throughput experimental methods for discovery of PTMs are very laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for computational methods and powerful tools to predict PTMs. There are vast amounts of PTMs data, which are publicly accessible through many online databases. In this survey, we comprehensively reviewed the major online databases and related tools. The current challenges of computational methods were reviewed in detail as well.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In common with other omics technologies, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics produces ever-increasing amounts of raw data, making their efficient analysis a principal challenge. There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</jats:p>",

In particular, protein contaminants from reagents and sample handling are often abundant and almost impossible to avoid. For data-dependent acquisition (DDA) proteomics, exclusion list can be used to reduce the influence of protein contaminants. However, protein contamination has not been evaluated and is rarely addressed in data-independent acquisition (DIA). How protein contaminants influence proteomics data is also unclear. In this study, we established protein contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries that are applicable to all proteomic workflows and evaluated the impact of protein contaminants on both DDA and DIA proteomics. We demonstrated that including our contaminant libraries can reduce false discoveries and increase protein identifications, without influencing the quantification accuracy in various proteomic software platforms. With the pressing need to standardize proteomic workflow in the research community, we highly recommend including our contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries in all bottom-up proteomics workflow. Our contaminant libraries and a step-by-step tutorial to incorporate these libraries in different DDA and DIA data analysis platforms can be valuable resources for proteomics researchers, which are freely accessible at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib\">https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>",

They recognize proteins, nucleic acids, and other types of partners; they accelerate interactions and chemical reactions between bound partners; and they help accommodate posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, protein fusions, and insertions or deletions. Overall, IDP-associated biological activities complement those of structured proteins. Recently, there has been an explosion of studies on IDP regions and their functions, yet the discovery and investigation of these proteins have a long, mostly ignored history. Along with recent discoveries, we present several early examples and the mechanisms by which IDPs contribute to function, which we hope will encourage comprehensive discussion of IDPs and IDP regions in biochemistry textbooks.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> An accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach for proteomic analyses has been developed over the past several years to facilitate comprehensive high-throughput proteomic measurements. An AMT tag database for an organism, tissue, or cell line is established by initially performing standard shotgun proteomic analysis and, most importantly, by validating peptide identifications using the mass measurement accuracy of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC) elution time constraint. Creation of an AMT tag database largely obviates the need for subsequent MS/MS analyses, and thus facilitates high-throughput analyses. The strength of this technology resides in the ability to achieve highly efficient and reproducible one-dimensional reversed-phased LC separations in conjunction with highly accurate mass measurements using FTICR MS. Recent improvements allow for the analysis of as little as picrogram amounts of proteome samples by minimizing sample handling and maximizing peptide recovery. The nanoproteomics platform has also demonstrated the ability to detect &gt;10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> differences in protein abundances and identify more abundant proteins from subpicogram amounts of samples. The AMT tag approach is poised to become a new standard technique for the in-depth and high-throughput analysis of complex organisms and clinical samples, with the potential to extend the analysis to a single mammalian cell. </jats:p>",

This follow-up study aims at optimising the digestion of medicinal cannabis proteins for identification purposes by bottom-up and middle-down proteomics (BUP and MDP). Four proteases, namely a mixture of trypsin/LysC, GluC, and chymotrypsin, which target different amino acids (AAs) and therefore are orthogonal and cleave proteins more or less frequently, were tested both on their own as well as sequentially or pooled, followed by nLC-MS/MS analyses of the peptide digests. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa) was used as a control of digestion efficiency. With this multiple protease strategy, BSA was reproducibly 97% sequenced, with peptides ranging from 0.7 to 6.4 kD containing 5 to 54 AA residues with 0 to 6 miscleavages. The proteome of mature apical buds from medicinal cannabis was explored more in depth with the identification of 27,123 peptides matching 494 unique accessions corresponding to 229 unique proteins from Cannabis sativa and close relatives, including 130 (57%) additional annotations when the list is compared to that of our previous BUP study (Vincent, D., et al. Molecules 2019, 24, 659). Almost half of the medicinal cannabis proteins were identified with 100% sequence coverage, with peptides composed of 7 to 91 AA residues with up to 9 miscleavages and ranging from 0.6 to 10 kDa, thus falling into the MDP domain. Many post-translational modifications (PTMs) were identified, such as oxidation, phosphorylations, and N-terminus acetylations. This method will pave the way for deeper proteome exploration of the reproductive organs of medicinal cannabis, and therefore for molecular phenotyping within breeding programs.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.",

    "abstract": "Studies on gastric digestion during 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the agent which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes the dissolution of nutrients such as meat or coagulated egg white. Soon afterward it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to diffusible products named peptones. Efforts to isolate and purify pepsin were spurred by its widespread adoption for the treatment of digestive disorders, and highly active preparations were available by the end of the nineteenth century. There was uncertainty, however, as to the chemical nature of pepsin, for some preparations exhibited the properties of proteins while other preparations failed to do so. The question was not settled until after 1930, when Northrop crystallized swine pepsin and provided convincing evidence for its identity as a protein. The availability of this purified pepsin during the 1930s also led to the discovery of the first synthetic peptide substrates for pepsin, thus providing needed evidence for the peptide structure of native proteins, a matter of debate at that time. After 1945, with the introduction of new separation methods, notably chromatography and electrophoresis, and the availability of specific proteinases, the amino acid sequences of many proteins, including pepsin and its precursor pepsinogen, were determined. Moreover, treatment of pepsin with chemical reagents indicated the participation in the catalytic mechanism of two aspartyl units widely separated in the linear sequence. Studies on the kinetics of pepsin action on long chain synthetic peptides suggested that the catalytic site was an extended structure. Similar properties were found for other \"aspartyl proteinases,\" such as chymosin (used in cheese making), some intracellular proteinases (cathepsins), and plant proteinases. After 1975, the three-dimensional structures of pepsin and many of its relatives were determined by means of x-ray diffraction techniques, greatly extending our insight into the mechanism of the catalytic action of these enzymes. That knowledge has led to the design of new inhibitors of aspartyl proteinases, which are participants in the maturation of human immunodeficiency virus and in the generation of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The determination of disulfide bonds is an important aspect of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the chemical structure of a protein. The basic strategy for obtaining this information involves the identification of disulfide-linked peptides in digests of proteins and the characterization of their half-cystinyl peptide constituents. Tools for disulfide bond analysis have improved dramatically in the past two decades, especially in terms of speed and sensitivity. This improvement is largely due to the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), and complementary analyzers with high resolution and accuracy. The process of pairing half-cystinyl peptides is now generally achieved by comparing masses of non-reduced and reduced aliquots of a digest of a protein that was proteolyzed with intact disulfide bonds. Pepsin has favorable properties for generating disulfide-linked peptides, including its acidic pH optimum, at which disulfide bond rearrangement is precluded and protein conformations are likely to be unfolded and accessible to cleavage, and broad substrate specificity. These properties potentiate cleavage between all half-cystine residues of the substrate protein. However, pepsin produces complex digests that contain overlapping peptides due to ragged cleavage. This complexity can produce very complex spectra and/or hamper the ionization of some constituent peptides. It may also be more difficult to compute which half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest are disulfide-linked in non-reduced peptic digests. This ambiguity is offset to some extent by sequence tags that may arise from ragged cleavages and aid sequence assignments. Problems associated with pepsin cleavage can be minimized by digestion in solvents that contain 50% H(2) (18)O. Resultant disulfide-linked peptides have distinct isotope profiles (combinations of isotope ratios and average mass increases) compared to the same peptides with only (16)O in their terminal carboxylates. Thus, it is possible to identify disulfide-linked peptides in digests and chromatographic fractions, using these mass-specific markers, and to rationalize mass changes upon reduction in terms of half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest. Some peptides may require additional cleavages due to their multiple disulfide bond contents and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine linkages. Interpretation of the MS/MS spectra of peptides with multiple disulfides in supplementary digests is also facilitated by the presence of (18)O in their terminal carboxylates.",

The enzymes used were trypsin, Lys-C, and Asp-N, which cleave at arginine and lysine residues, lysine, and aspartic acid residues, respectively. This approach was evaluated with the glycoprotein, tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA and gave enhanced sequence coverage, compared with a single enzymatic digest. The approach was then evaluated with a complex proteomic sample, namely plasma. It was found that trypsin and Lys-C were able to detect overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and a digital recombination of the data gave a significant increase in both the number of protein identifications as well as an increase in the number of peptides identified per protein (which improves the certainty of the assignment).",

    "abstract": "We developed a sensitive fluorescence assay for the quantitation of proteins in solution using the NanoOrange reagent, a merocyanine dye that produces a large increase in fluorescence quantum yield upon interaction with detergent-coated proteins. The NanoOrange assay allowed for the detection of 10 ng/mL to 10 micrograms/mL protein with a standard fluorometer, offering a broad, dynamic quantitation range and improved sensitivity relative to absorption-based protein solution assays. The protein-to-protein variability of the NanoOrange assay was comparable to those of standard assays, including Lowry, bicinchoninic acid, and Bradford procedures. We also found that the NanoOrange assay is useful for detecting relatively small proteins or large peptides, such as aprotinin and insulin. The assay was somewhat sensitive to the presence of several common contaminants found in protein preparations such as salts and detergents; however, it was insensitive to the presence of reducing agents, nucleic acids, and free amino acids. The simple assay protocol is suitable for automation. Samples are briefly heated in the presence of dye in a detergent-containing diluent, allowed to cool to room temperature, and fluorescence is measured using 485-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths. Therefore, the NanoOrange assay is well suited for use with standard fluorescence microplate readers, fluorometers, and some laser scanners.",

Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and query interfaces. The central database will have two sections, corresponding to the familiar Swiss-Prot (fully manually curated entries) and TrEMBL (enriched with automated classification, annotation and extensive cross-references). For convenient sequence searches, UniProt also provides several non-redundant sequence databases. The UniProt NREF (UniRef) databases provide representative subsets of the knowledgebase suitable for efficient searching. The comprehensive UniProt Archive (UniParc) is updated daily from many public source databases. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub).

These reagents may be used to modify proteins in solution, as well as proteins in gel slices, prior to proteolytic digestion and mass spectral analysis. The procedure eliminates several steps with both types of samples. Samples in solution do not need to be desalted following reduction and alkylation, with excess reagent being removed under vacuum. For gel slices, the procedure combines washing, destaining, reduction and alkylation into a single step. The procedure was applied successfully to samples as complex as serum, and we demonstrated alkylation of cysteines to be quantitative in purified proteins. We also were able to reduce and alkylate proteins with these reagents during the gas phase. Elimination of the need for desalting of samples after reaction raised the possibility of automation of the procedure for liquid samples, which is difficult with conventional reduction and alkylation chemistries.",

    "abstract": "The shotgun proteomic strategy based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry and automated database searching has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in most large scale studies. However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.",

In this work, we represent the chaotropic agent as a factor that reduces the amount of order in the structures formed by water molecules, both in the bulk and the hydration shells around hydrophobic amino acids. In this framework we show that low chaotrope concentrations lead to a destabilization of the native state of proteins, and that high concentrations induce complete denaturation. We also find that the reduction of the number of bulk ordered states of water molecules can give origin to an effective interaction between chaotropic molecules and proteins.",

    "abstract": "Detergents have been widely used for the solubilization of membrane proteins and the improvement of their digestion. In this paper, we have evaluated the application of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) to the solubilization and digestion of rat hippocampal plasma membrane (PM) proteins. For in-solution digestion, rat hippocampal PM fraction from sucrose-density gradient centrifugation was solubilized by boiling in 1.0% SDC, and directly digested without dilution. During the in-gel digestion of the hippocampal PM proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, 0.1% SDC was added. Before analysis of peptide mixture by liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry, SDC in the tryptic digests was removed by centrifugation following acidification. Use of 1.0% SDC in solubilization and in-solution digestion of rat PM proteins had led to 77 PM or membrane-associated proteins identified, a more than 2-fold increase over that by use of SDS. The addition of 0.1% SDC to the in-gel digestion of SDS-PAGE-resolved membrane proteins remarkably enhanced the coverage of tryptic peptides and the number of hydrophobic membrane proteins identified. Being a cheaper and more tractable acid-insoluble detergent, SDC could be used at higher concentration in the solubilization and tryptic digestion of proteins including PM proteins with the purpose of enhancing the protein solubility and at the same time making no interference with trypsin activity and subsequent analyses.",

Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new protocol for digesting hydrophobic proteins using trypsin with the aid of phase-transfer surfactants (PTS), such as sodium deoxycholate (SDC). SDC increases the solubility of hydrophobic proteins, enhances the activity of trypsin, and improves the accessibility to trypsin of proteins denatured during the extraction process. After digestion, SDC was successfully removed from the acidified solution containing tryptic peptides by adding a water-immiscible organic solvent, into which SDC was predominantly transferred, while the digested peptides remained in the aqueous phase. Compared with a protocol using an acid-labile surfactant, this PTS protocol increased the number of identified proteins and the recovery of hydrophobic peptides in the analysis of 400 ng of a membrane-enriched fraction of Escherichia coli. Application of the PTS protocol to 9.0 microg of a membrane-enriched pellet from human cervical cancer HeLa cells resulted in identification of a total of 1450 proteins, of which 764 (53%) were membrane proteins, by two-dimensional strong cation exchange (SCX)-C18 LC-MSMS with 5 SCX fractions. The distribution of the number of transmembrane domains in proteins identified in this study was in agreement with that in the IPI human database, suggesting that the PTS protocol can provide unbiased digestion of the membrane proteome.",

When analyzed by electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-based mass spectrometric sequencing, Lys-N-digested peptides that contain a single lysine residue produce spectra dominated by c-type fragment ions, providing simple ladders for sequence determination. This method should be a valuable strategy for de novo sequencing and the analysis of post-translational modifications.",

Efforts to continuously minimize sample volumes and measurable concentrations increase the need to understand where these interferences come from, how they can be identified, and if they can be eliminated. Knowledge of identity enables their use as internal calibrants for accurate mass measurements. This review/tutorial summarizes current literature on reported contaminants and introduces a number of novel interferences that have been observed and identified in our laboratories over the past decade. These include both compounds of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous nature. In the supplemental data a spreadsheet is provided that contains a searchable ion list of all compounds identified to date.",

    "abstract": "Proteomic analysis typically has been performed using proteins digested with trypsin because of the excellent fragmentation patterns they produce in collision induced dissociation (CID). For analyses in which high protein coverage is desirable, such as global monitoring of post-translational modifications, additional sequences can be seen using parallel digestion with a second enzyme. We have benchmarked a relatively obscure basidomycete-derived zinc metalloendopeptidase, Lys-N, that selectively cleaves the amide bond N-terminal of lysine residues. We have found that Lys-N digestion yields peptides with easily assigned CID spectra. Using a mixture of purified proteins as well as a complex yeast lysate, we have shown that Lys-N efficiently digests all proteins at the predicted sites of cleavage. Shotgun proteomics analyses of Lys-N digests of both the standard mixture and yeast lysate yielded peptide and protein identification numbers that were generally comparable to trypsin digestion, whereas the combination data from Lys-N and trypsin digestion substantially enhanced protein coverage. During CID fragmentation, the additional amino terminal basicity enhanced b-ion intensity which was reflected in long b-ion tags that were particularly pronounced during CID in a quadrupole. Finally, immonium ion peaks produced from Lys-N digested peptides originate from the carboxy terminus in contrast to tryptic peptides where immonium ions originate from the amino terminus.",

    "abstract": "A method is described for the preparation of a crystalline protein from commercial pepsin preparations which has powerful peptic activity. The composition, optical activity, and proteolytic activity of this protein remain constant through seven successive crystallizations. No evidence for the presence of a mixture or of a solid solution is found in a study of the solubility of the protein in a series of different salt solutions, nor from the diffusion coefficient or from the rate of inactivation. These results indicate that the material is a pure substance or possibly a solid solution of two or more substances having nearly the same solubility in all the various solvents studied. It seems reasonable to conclude from these experiments that the possibility of a mixture must be limited to a mixture of proteins, so that the conclusion seems justified that pepsin itself is a protein.",

In particular, how much of the protein is needed, what should be its state of purity, and must it be folded correctly and associated with various other peptides or cofactors. Using such criteria, an appropriate assay should be chosen and a procedure be planned taking into account the source of the protein, how it is to be extracted from the source, and what agents the protein ought to be exposed to or ultimately be stored in. One is often surprised at the time necessary to develop an appropriate protein purification procedure relative to the time required to clone a gene or to accumulate information with the purified protein. There are an overwhelming number of options for protein purification steps, so forethought is necessary to expedite the tedious job of developing the purification scheme, or to avoid having to redesign it upon attempting to use the protein. This chapter points out general considerations to be undertaken in designing, organizing, and executing the purification, while subsequent chapters of this volume supply more specific options and technical details.",

Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale protein sequencing methods rely on enzymatic digestion of complex protein mixtures to generate a collection of peptides for mass spectrometric analysis. Here we examine the use of multiple proteases (trypsin, LysC, ArgC, AspN, and GluC) to improve both protein identification and characterization in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a data-dependent, decision tree-based algorithm to tailor MS(2) fragmentation method to peptide precursor, we identified 92 095 unique peptides (609 665 total) mapping to 3908 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). These results were a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest (trypsin) - 27 822 unique peptides corresponding to 3313 proteins. The additional 595 protein identifications were mainly from those at low abundances (i.e., < 1000 copies/cell); sequence coverage for these proteins was likewise improved nearly 3-fold. We demonstrate that large portions of the proteome are simply inaccessible following digestion with a single protease and that multiple proteases, rather than technical replicates, provide a direct route to increase both protein identifications and proteome sequence coverage.",

Pitfalls in interpretation, different database search strategies to minimize erroneous identifications and an augmented contaminant database are presented.",

    "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers studies are based on the differential expression of proteins between different treatment groups or between diseased and control populations. Most mass spectrometry-based methods of protein quantitation, however, are based on the detection and quantitation of peptides, not intact proteins. For peptide-based protein quantitation to be accurate, the digestion protocols used in proteomic analyses must be both efficient and reproducible. There have been very few studies, however, where plasma denaturation/digestion protocols have been compared using absolute quantitation methods. In this paper, 14 combinations of heat, solvent [acetonitrile, methanol, trifluoroethanol], chaotropic agents [guanidine hydrochloride, urea], and surfactants [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium deoxycholate (DOC)] were compared with respect to their effectiveness in improving subsequent tryptic digestion. These digestion protocols were evaluated by quantitating the production of proteotypic tryptic peptides from 45 moderate- to high-abundance plasma proteins, using tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with a mixture of stable-isotope labeled analogues of these proteotypic peptides as internal standards. When the digestion efficiencies of these 14 methods were compared, we found that both of the surfactants (SDS and DOC) produced an increase in the overall yield of tryptic peptides from these 45 proteins, when compared to the more commonly used urea protocol. SDS, however, can be a serious interference for subsequent mass spectrometry. DOC, on the other hand, can be easily removed from the samples by acid precipitation. Examining the results of a reproducibility study, done with 5 replicate digestions, DOC and SDS with a 9 h digestion time produced the highest average digestion efficiencies (∼80%), with the highest average reproducibility (<5% error, defined as the relative deviation from the mean value). However, because of potential interferences resulting from the use of SDS, we recommend DOC with a 9 h digestion procedure as the optimum protocol.",

Disruption of the plasma membrane (PM) by mechanical forces to investigate the content of the cell is common practice. Whether vesicles or membranes of different sources can fuse as a result is unclear. If such contamination occurs, conclusions based on these techniques should consider these. Utilizing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane marker and a PM marker, we were able to detect the source of membranes following the breakup of cells using flow cytometry and immuno Electron Microscopy (immuno EM). Fractionation processes produced a small fraction of new membrane entities from two distinctively different origins generated during the initial disruption steps in a temperature independent manner, stressing that defining organelles or intrinsic fusion events based on such procedures and markers are valid when exceeding the small number of vesicles fused during the fractionation process.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the implementation of various denaturants and their efficacy in bottom-up membrane proteomic methods using LC-MS analysis, microsomes isolated from tomato roots were treated with MS-compatible surfactants (RapiGest SF Surfactant from Waters and PPS Silent Surfactant from Protein Discovery), a chaotropic reagent (guanidine hydrochloride), and an organic solvent (methanol). Peptides were analyzed in triplicate sample and technical replicates by data-independent LC-MS(E) analysis. Overall, 2333 unique peptides matching to 662 unique proteins were detected with the order of denaturant method efficacy being RapiGest SF Surfactant, PPS Silent Surfactant, guanidine hydrochloride, and methanol. Using bioinformatic analysis, 103 proteins were determined to be integral membrane proteins. When normalizing the data as a percentage of the overall number of peptides and proteins identified for each method, the order for integral membrane protein identification efficacy was methanol, guanidine hydrochloride, RapiGest SF Surfactant, and PPS Silent Surfactant. Interestingly, only 8% of the proteins were identified in all four methods with the silent surfactants having the greatest overlap at 17%. GRAVY analysis at the protein and peptide level indicated that methanol and guanidine hydrochloride promoted detection of hydrophobic proteins and peptides, respectively; however, trypsin activity in the presence of each denaturant was determined as a major factor contributing to peptide identification by LC-MS(E) . These results reveal the complementary nature of each denaturant method, which can be used in an integrated approach to provide a more effective bottom-up analysis of membrane proteomes than can be achieved using only a single denaturant.",

    "abstract": "We used deep sequencing technology to profile the transcriptome, gene copy number, and CpG island methylation status simultaneously in eight commonly used breast cell lines to develop a model for how these genomic features are integrated in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative breast cancer. Total mRNA sequence, gene copy number, and genomic CpG island methylation were carried out using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Sequences were mapped to the human genome to obtain digitized gene expression data, DNA copy number in reference to the non-tumor cell line (MCF10A), and methylation status of 21,570 CpG islands to identify differentially expressed genes that were correlated with methylation or copy number changes. These were evaluated in a dataset from 129 primary breast tumors. Gene expression in cell lines was dominated by ER-associated genes. ER+ and ER- cell lines formed two distinct, stable clusters, and 1,873 genes were differentially expressed in the two groups. Part of chromosome 8 was deleted in all ER- cells and part of chromosome 17 amplified in all ER+ cells. These loci encoded 30 genes that were overexpressed in ER+ cells; 9 of these genes were overexpressed in ER+ tumors. We identified 149 differentially expressed genes that exhibited differential methylation of one or more CpG islands within 5 kb of the 5' end of the gene and for which mRNA abundance was inversely correlated with CpG island methylation status. In primary tumors we identified 84 genes that appear to be robust components of the methylation signature that we identified in ER+ cell lines. Our analyses reveal a global pattern of differential CpG island methylation that contributes to the transcriptome landscape of ER+ and ER- breast cancer cells and tumors. The role of gene amplification/deletion appears to more modest, although several potentially significant genes appear to be regulated by copy number aberrations.",

    "abstract": "Second-generation sequencing technologies are precipitating major shifts with regards to what kinds of genomes are being sequenced and how they are annotated. While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies.",

Peptides generated from a mixture of five standard proteins digested with trypsin, elastase, or pepsin were separated with nanoflow liquid chromatography using mobile phases modified with either 5% DMSO or 0.1%m-NBA. Eluting peptides were ionized by online electrospray and sequenced by both CID and ETD using data-dependent MS/MS. Statistically significant improvements in peptide identifications were observed with DMSO co-solvent. In order to understand this observation, we assessed the effects of supercharging reagents on the chromatographic separation and the electrospray quality. The increase in identifications was not due to supercharging, which was greater for the 0.1%m-NBA co-solvent and not observed for the 5.0% DMSO co-solvent. The improved MS/MS efficiency using the DMSO modified mobile phase appeared to result from charge state coalescence.",

Digestion conditions include double tryptic, surfactant-assisted, and tandem-combinatorial Lys-C/trypsin digestion. In comparison to tryptic digests, Lys-C/trypsin digests were found most efficient to yield fully cleaved peptides while reducing the abundance of miscleaved peptides. Subsequent sequence context analysis revealed improved digestion performances of Lys-C/trypsin for miscleaved sequence stretches flanked by charged basic and particulary acidic residues. Furthermore, targeted MS analysis demonstrated a more comprehensive protein cleavage only after Lys-C/trypsin digestion, resulting in a more accurrate absolute protein quantification and extending the number of peptides suitable for SRM assay development. Therefore, we conclude that a serial Lys-C/trypsin digestion is highly attractive for most applications in quantitative MS-based proteomics building on in-solution digestion schemes.",

    "abstract": "The hydrophobic nature of most membrane proteins severely complicates their extraction, proteolysis and identification. Although detergents can be used to enhance the solubility of the membrane proteins, it is often difficult for a detergent not only to have a strong ability to extract membrane proteins, but also to be compatible with the subsequent proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis. In this study, we made evaluation on a novel application of sodium laurate (SL) to the shotgun analysis of membrane proteomes. SL was found not only to lyse the membranes and solubilize membrane proteins as efficiently as SDS, but also to be well compatible with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, SL could be efficiently removed by phase transfer method from samples after acidification, thus ensuring not to interfere with the subsequent CapLC-MS/MS analysis of the proteolytic peptides of proteins. When SL was applied to assist the digestion and identification of a standard protein mixture containing bacteriorhodoposin and the proteins in rat liver plasma membrane-enriched fractions, it was found that, compared with other two representative enzyme- and MS-compatible detergents RapiGest SF (RGS) and sodium deoxycholate (SDC), SL exhibited obvious superiority in the identification of membrane proteins particularly those with high hydrophobicity and/or multiple transmembrane domains.",

    "abstract": "The majority of mass spectrometry-based protein quantification studies uses peptide-centric analytical methods and thus strongly relies on efficient and unbiased protein digestion protocols for sample preparation. We present a novel objective approach to assess protein digestion efficiency using a combination of qualitative and quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem MS methods and statistical data analysis. In contrast to previous studies we employed both standard qualitative as well as data-independent quantitative workflows to systematically assess trypsin digestion efficiency and bias using mitochondrial protein fractions. We evaluated nine trypsin-based digestion protocols, based on standard in-solution or on spin filter-aided digestion, including new optimized protocols. We investigated various reagents for protein solubilization and denaturation (dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, urea), several trypsin digestion conditions (buffer, RapiGest, deoxycholate, urea), and two methods for removal of detergents before analysis of peptides (acid precipitation or phase separation with ethyl acetate). Our data-independent quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem MS workflow quantified over 3700 distinct peptides with 96% completeness between all protocols and replicates, with an average 40% protein sequence coverage and an average of 11 peptides identified per protein. Systematic quantitative and statistical analysis of physicochemical parameters demonstrated that deoxycholate-assisted in-solution digestion combined with phase transfer allows for efficient, unbiased generation and recovery of peptides from all protein classes, including membrane proteins. This deoxycholate-assisted protocol was also optimal for spin filter-aided digestions as compared with existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a widely used approach for the identification of protein-protein interactions. However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (for example, proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol. Here we present the contaminant repository for affinity purification (the CRAPome) and describe its use for scoring protein-protein interactions. The repository (currently available for Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and computational tools are freely accessible at http://www.crapome.org/. ",

    "abstract": "Urea solution is one of the most commonly employed protein denaturants for protease digestion in proteomic studies. However, it has long been recognized that urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues. Protein/peptide carbamylation blocks protease digestion and affects protein identification and quantification in mass spectrometry analysis by blocking peptide amino groups from isotopic/isobaric labeling and changing peptide charge states, retention times, and masses. In addition, protein carbamylation during sample preparation makes it difficult to study in vivo protein carbamylation. In this study, we compared the peptide carbamylation in urea solutions of different buffers and found that ammonium-containing buffers were the most effective buffers to inhibit protein carbamylation in urea solution. The possible mechanism of carbamylation inhibition by ammonium-containing buffers is discussed, and a revised procedure for the protease digestion of proteins in urea and ammonium-containing buffers was developed to facilitate its application in proteomic research.

    "abstract": "The structural characterization of proteins and peptides isolated in minute quantities requires the most efficient use of available sample. A mass spectrometer data system was programmed to continuously evaluate incoming liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry data against a user-defined array of information. The resulting conclusions were used to automatically set and modify acquisition parameters in real time to collect collision-induced dissociation spectra for selected ions (tandem mass spectrometry). This approach has provided a mechanism to target specific subsets of masses in a complex mixture and/or to discriminate selectively against masses that are known or not of interest. Masses of contaminants or peptide masses derived from known proteins can be automatically recorded and removed from further consideration for collision-induced dissociation analysis. Once recorded, these \"libraries\" of masses can be used across multiple analyses. This technique directs the mass spectrometer data system to focus on the analysis of masses significant to the user, even if their signal intensities are well below the intensities of contaminating masses. When combined with a database search program to correlate tandem mass spectra to known protein sequences, the identity of the protein can be established unequivocally by using less than 100 fmol of sample.

    "abstract": "A method to correlate the uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of peptides produced under low energy (10-50 eV) collision conditions with amino acid sequences in the Genpept database has been developed. In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of ±1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database. ",

    "abstract": "Quantitative and qualitative protein characteristics are regulated at genomic, transcriptomic, and posttranscriptional levels. Here, we integrated in-depth transcriptome and proteome analyses of liver tissues from two rat strains to unravel the interactions within and between these layers. We obtained peptide evidence for 26,463 rat liver proteins. We validated 1,195 gene predictions, 83 splice events, 126 proteins with nonsynonymous variants, and 20 isoforms with nonsynonymous RNA editing. Quantitative RNA sequencing and proteomics data correlate highly between strains but poorly among each other, indicating extensive nongenetic regulation. Our multilevel analysis identified a genomic variant in the promoter of the most differentially expressed gene Cyp17a1, a previously reported top hit in genome-wide association studies for human hypertension, as a potential contributor to the hypertension phenotype in SHR rats. These results demonstrate the power of and need for integrative analysis for understanding genetic control of molecular dynamics and phenotypic diversity in a system-wide manner. ",

    "abstract": "Bottom-up proteomics largely relies on tryptic peptides for protein identification and quantification. Tryptic digestion often provides limited coverage of protein sequence because of issues such as peptide length, ionization efficiency, and post-translational modification colocalization. Unfortunately, a region of interest in a protein, for example, because of proximity to an active site or the presence of important post-translational modifications, may not be covered by tryptic peptides. Detection limits, quantification accuracy, and isoform differentiation can also be improved with greater sequence coverage. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) would also greatly benefit from being able to identify additional targetable sequences. In an attempt to improve protein sequence coverage and to target regions of proteins that do not generate useful tryptic peptides, we deployed a multiprotease strategy on the HeLa proteome. First, we used seven commercially available enzymes in single, double, and triple enzyme combinations. A total of 48 digests were performed. 5223 proteins were detected by analyzing the unfractionated cell lysate digest directly; with 42% mean sequence coverage. Additional strong-anion exchange fractionation of the most complementary digests permitted identification of over 3000 more proteins, with improved mean sequence coverage. We then constructed a web application (https://proteomics.swmed.edu/confetti) that allows the community to examine a target protein or protein isoform in order to discover the enzyme or combination of enzymes that would yield peptides spanning a certain region of interest in the sequence. Finally, we examined the use of nontryptic digests for SRM. From our strong-anion exchange fractionation data, we were able to identify three or more proteotypic SRM candidates within a single digest for 6056 genes. Surprisingly, in 25% of these cases the digest producing the most observable proteotypic peptides was neither trypsin nor Lys-C. SRM analysis of Asp-N versus tryptic peptides for eight proteins determined that Asp-N yielded higher signal in five of eight cases. ",

The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight and fosters the development of proteomic technology. ",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond identification is important for a detailed understanding of protein structures, which directly affect their biological functions. Here we describe an integrated workflow for the fast and accurate identification of authentic protein disulfide bridges. This novel workflow incorporates acidic proteolytic digestion using pepsin to eliminate undesirable disulfide reshuffling during sample preparation and a novel search engine, SlinkS, to directly identify disulfide-bridged peptides isolated via electron transfer higher energy dissociation (EThcD). In EThcD fragmentation of disulfide-bridged peptides, electron transfer dissociation preferentially leads to the cleavage of the S-S bonds, generating two intense disulfide-cleaved peptides as primary fragment ions. Subsequently, higher energy collision dissociation primarily targets unreacted and charge-reduced precursor ions, inducing peptide backbone fragmentation. SlinkS is able to provide the accurate monoisotopic precursor masses of the two disulfide-cleaved peptides and the sequence of each linked peptide by matching the remaining EThcD product ions against a linear peptide database. The workflow was validated using a protein mixture containing six proteins rich in natural disulfide bridges. Using this pepsin-based workflow, we were able to efficiently and confidently identify a total of 31 unique Cys-Cys bonds (out of 43 disulfide bridges present), with no disulfide reshuffling products detected. Pepsin digestion not only outperformed trypsin digestion in terms of the number of detected authentic Cys-Cys bonds, but, more important, prevented the formation of artificially reshuffled disulfide bridges due to protein digestion under neutral pH. Our new workflow therefore provides a precise and generic approach for disulfide bridge mapping, which can be used to study protein folding, structure, and stability. ",

    "abstract": "Proteins regulate many cellular functions and analyzing the presence and abundance of proteins in biological samples are central focuses in proteomics. The discovery and validation of biomarkers, pathways, and drug targets for various diseases can be accomplished using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. However, with mass-limited samples like tumor biopsies, it can be challenging to obtain sufficient amounts of proteins to generate high-quality mass spectrometric data. Techniques developed for macroscale quantities recover sufficient amounts of protein from milligram quantities of starting material, but sample losses become crippling with these techniques when only microgram amounts of material are available. To combat this challenge, proteomicists have developed micro-scale techniques that are compatible with decreased sample size (100 μg or lower) and still enable excellent proteome coverage. Extraction, contaminant removal, protein quantitation, and sample handling techniques for the microgram protein range are reviewed here, with an emphasis on liquid chromatography and bottom-up mass spectrometry-compatible techniques. Also, a range of biological specimens, including mammalian tissues and model cell culture systems, are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Peptide-centered shotgun analysis of proteins has been the core technology in mass spectrometry based proteomics and has enabled numerous biological discoveries, such as the large-scale charting of protein-protein interaction networks, the quantitative analysis of protein post-translational modifications and even the first drafts of the human proteome. The conversion of proteins into peptides in these so-called bottom-up approaches is nearly uniquely done by using trypsin as a proteolytic reagent. Here, we argue that our view of the proteome still remains incomplete and this is partially due to the nearly exclusive use of trypsin. Newly emerging alternative proteases and/or multi-protease protein digestion aim to increase proteome sequence coverage and improve the identification of post-translational modifications, through the analysis of complementary and often longer peptides, introducing an approach termed middle-down proteomics. Of pivotal importance for this purpose is the identification of proteases beneficial for use in proteomics. Here, we describe some of the shortcomings of the nearly exclusive use of trypsin in proteomics and review the properties of other proteomics-appropriate proteases. We describe favorable protease traits with an emphasis on middle-down proteomics and suggest potential sources for the discovery of new proteases. We also highlight a few examples wherein the use of other proteases than trypsin enabled the generation of more comprehensive data sets leading to previously unexplored knowledge of the proteome. ",

    "abstract": "Colorimetric protein assays, such as the Coomassie blue G-250 dye-binding (Bradford) and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays, are commonly used to quantify protein concentration. The accuracy of these assays depends on the amino acid composition. Because of the extensive use of reductive methylation in the study of proteins and the importance of biological methylation, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of lysyl methylation on the Bradford and BCA assays. Unmodified and reductively methylated proteins were analyzed using the absorbance at 280 nm to standardize the concentrations. Using model compounds, we demonstrate that the dimethylation of lysyl ε-amines does not affect the proteins' molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm. For the Bradford assay, the responses (absorbance per unit concentration) of the unmodified and reductively methylated proteins were similar, with a slight decrease in the response upon methylation. For the BCA assay, the responses of the reductively methylated proteins were consistently higher, overestimating the concentrations of the methylated proteins. The enhanced color formation in the BCA assay may be due to the lower acid dissociation constants of the lysyl ε-dimethylamines compared with the unmodified ε-amine, favoring Cu(II) binding in biuret-like complexes. The implications for the analysis of biologically methylated samples are discussed. ",

Surprisingly, we identified cleavage sites for this enzyme at the N-terminal side of several glutamyl residues in addition to the expected cleavage sites at aspartyl residues. The ability of this enzyme to cleave polypeptides at both glutamyl and aspartyl residues was confirmed by mapping additional sites on erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I.

    "abstract": "Common yet often overlooked, deamidation of peptidyl asparagine (Asn or N) generates aspartic acid (Asp or D) or isoaspartic acid (isoAsp or isoD). Being a spontaneous, non-enzymatic protein post-translational modification, deamidation artifact can be easily introduced during sample preparation, especially proteolysis where higher-order structures are removed. This artifact not only complicates the analysis of bona fide deamidation but also affects a wide range of chemical and enzymatic processes; for instance, the newly generated Asp and isoAsp residues may block or introduce new proteolytic sites, and also convert one Asn peptide into multiple species that affect quantification. While the neutral to mildly basic conditions for common proteolysis favor deamidation, mildly acidic conditions markedly slow down the process. Unlike other commonly used endoproteases, Glu-C remains active under mildly acid conditions. As such, as demonstrated herein, deamidation artifact during proteolysis was effectively eliminated by simply performing Glu-C digestion at pH 4.5 in ammonium acetate, a volatile buffer that is compatible with mass spectrometry. Moreover, nearly identical sequence specificity was observed at both pH's (8.0 for ammonium bicarbonate), rendering Glu-C as effective at pH 4.5. In summary, this method is generally applicable for protein analysis as it requires minimal sample preparation and uses the readily available Glu-C protease. ",

    "abstract": "Protein digestion using a dedicated protease represents a key element in a typical mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics experiment. Up to now, digestion has been predominantly performed with trypsin, mainly because of its high specificity, widespread availability and ease of use. Lately, it has become apparent that the sole use of trypsin in bottom-up proteomics may impose certain limits in our ability to grasp the full proteome, missing out particular sites of post-translational modifications, protein segments or even subsets of proteins. To overcome this problem, the proteomics community has begun to explore alternative proteases to complement trypsin. However, protocols, as well as expected results generated from these alternative proteases, have not been systematically documented. Therefore, here we provide an optimized protocol for six alternative proteases that have already shown promise in their applicability in proteomics, namely chymotrypsin, LysC, LysN, AspN, GluC and ArgC. This protocol is formulated to promote ease of use and robustness, which enable parallel digestion with each of the six tested proteases. We present data on protease availability and usage including recommendations for reagent preparation. We additionally describe the appropriate MS data analysis methods and the anticipated results in the case of the analysis of a single protein (BSA) and a more complex cellular lysate (Escherichia coli). The digestion protocol presented here is convenient and robust and can be completed in ∼2 d. ",

We also elaborate upon factors like composition and size of the search database that can influence the protein identification process. In conclusion, we suggest that choice of the database depends on the type of inferences to be derived from proteomics data.

    "abstract": "Structural information regarding metallothioneins (MTs) has been hard to come by due to its highly dynamic nature in the absence of metal-thiolate cluster formation and crystallization difficulties. Thus, typical spectroscopic methods for structural determination are limited in their usefulness when applied to MTs. Mass spectrometric methods have revolutionized our understanding of protein dynamics, structure, and folding. Recently, advances have been made in residue modification mass spectrometry in order to probe the hard-to-characterize structure of apo- and partially metalated MTs. By using different cysteine specific alkylation reagents, time dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and step-wise \"snapshot\" ESI-MS, we are beginning to understand the dynamics of the conformers of apo-MT and related species. In this review we highlight recent papers that use these and similar techniques for structure elucidation and attempt to explain in a concise manner the data interpretations of these complex methods. We expect increasing resolution in our picture of the structural conformations of metal-free MTs as these techniques are more widely adopted and combined with other promising tools for structural elucidation.",

    "abstract": "Reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues is part of virtually any proteomics workflow. Despite its frequent use, up to date no systematic investigation of the impact of different conditions on the outcome of proteomics studies has been performed. In this study, we compared common reduction reagents (dithiothreitol, tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, and β-mercaptoethanol) and alkylation reagents (iodoacetamide, iodoacetic acid, acrylamide, and chloroacetamide). Using in-gel digests as well as SAX fractionated in-solution digests of cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells, we evaluated 13 different reduction and alkylation conditions resulting in considerably varying identification rates. We observed strong differences in offsite alkylation reactions at 7 amino acids as well as at the peptide N terminus, identifying single and double adducts of all reagents. Using dimethyl labeling, mass tolerant searches, and synthetic peptide experiments, we identified alkylation of methionine residues by iodine-containing alkylation reagents as one of the major factors for the differences. We observed differences of more than 9-fold in numbers of identified methionine-containing peptide spectral matches for in-gel digested samples between iodine- and noniodine-containing alkylation reagents. This was because of formation of carbamidomethylated and carboxymethylated methionine side chains and a resulting prominent neutral loss during ESI ionization or in MS/MS fragmentation, strongly decreasing identification rates of methionine-containing peptides. We achieved best results with acrylamide as alkylation reagent, whereas the highest numbers of peptide spectral matches were obtained when reducing with dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol for the in-solution and the in-gel digested samples, respectively.",

Here, we performed an independent comparison between single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), and a commercial kit based on the in-StageTip (iST) method. We assessed their performance for the processing of proteomic samples in the low μg range using varying amounts of HeLa cell lysate (1-20 μg of total protein). All three workflows showed similar performances for 20 μg of starting material. When handling sample sizes below 10 μg, the number of identified proteins and peptides as well as the quantitative reproducibility and precision drastically dropped in case of FASP. In contrast, SP3 and iST provided high proteome coverage even in the low μg range. Even when digesting 1 μg of starting material, both methods still enabled the identification of over 3000 proteins and between 25 000 and 30 000 peptides. On average, the quantitative reproducibility between experimental replicates was slightly higher in case of SP3 (R",

    "abstract": "Protein structural changes induced by external perturbations or internal cues can profoundly influence protein activity and thus modulate cellular physiology. A number of biophysical approaches are available to probe protein structural changes, but these are not applicable to a whole proteome in a biological extract. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a recently developed proteomics approach that enables the identification of protein structural changes directly in their complex biological context on a proteome-wide scale. After perturbations of interest, proteome extracts are subjected to a double-protease digestion step with a nonspecific protease applied under native conditions, followed by complete digestion with the sequence-specific protease trypsin under denaturing conditions. This sequential treatment generates structure-specific peptides amenable to bottom-up MS analysis. Next, a proteomics workflow involving shotgun or targeted MS and label-free quantification is applied to measure structure-dependent proteolytic patterns directly in the proteome extract. Possible applications of LiP-MS include discovery of perturbation-induced protein structural alterations, identification of drug targets, detection of disease-associated protein structural states, and analysis of protein aggregates directly in biological samples. The approach also enables identification of the specific protein regions involved in the structural transition or affected by the binding event. Sample preparation takes approximately 2 d, followed by one to several days of MS and data analysis time, depending on the number of samples analyzed. Scientists with basic biochemistry training can implement the sample preparation steps. MS measurement and data analysis require a background in proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification regulates numerous cellular processes. Unlike ubiquitin, detection of endogenous SUMOylated proteins is limited by the lack of naturally occurring protease sites in the C-terminal tail of SUMO proteins. Proteome-wide detection of SUMOylation sites on target proteins typically requires ectopic expression of mutant SUMOs with introduced tryptic sites. Here, we report a method for proteome-wide, site-level detection of endogenous SUMOylation that uses α-lytic protease, WaLP. WaLP digestion of SUMOylated proteins generates peptides containing SUMO-remnant diglycyl-lysine (KGG) at the site of SUMO modification. Using previously developed immuno-affinity isolation of KGG-containing peptides followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 1209 unique endogenous SUMO modification sites. We also demonstrate the impact of proteasome inhibition on ubiquitin and SUMO-modified proteomes using parallel quantitation of ubiquitylated and SUMOylated peptides. This methodological advancement enables determination of endogenous SUMOylated proteins under completely native conditions.",

At present, the detection of PEG and other polymers relies largely on manual inspection of raw data, which is laborious and frequently difficult due to sample complexity and retention characteristics of polymer species in reversed-phase chromatography. We developed a new strategy for the automated identification of PEG molecules from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data using protein identification algorithms in combination with a database containing \"PEG-proteins\". Through definition of variable modifications, we extend the approach for the identification of commonly used PEG-based detergents. We exemplify the identification of different types of polymers by static nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS) analysis of pure detergent solutions and data analysis using Mascot. Analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) runs of a PEG-contaminated sample by Mascot identified 806 PEG spectra originating from four PEG species using a defined set of modifications covering PEG and common PEG-based detergents. Further characterization of the sample for unidentified PEG species using error-tolerant and mass-tolerant searches resulted in identification of 3409 and 3187 PEG-related MS/MS spectra, respectively. We further demonstrate the applicability of the strategy for Protein Pilot and MaxQuant.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of individual proteins is an essential task in understanding biological processes. For example, determination of concentrations of proteins transporting and metabolizing xenobiotics is a prerequisite for drug disposition predictions in humans based on in vitro data. So far, this task has frequently been accomplished by targeted proteomics. This type of analyses requires preparation of stable isotope labeled standards for each protein of interest. The selection of appropriate standard peptides is usually tedious and the number of proteins that can be studied in a single experiment by these approaches is limited. In addition, incomplete digestion of proteins often affects the accuracy of the quantification. To circumvent these constrains in proteomic protein quantification, label- and standard-free approaches, such as \"total protein approach\" (TPA) have been proposed. Here we directly compare an approach using stable isotope labeled (SIL) standards and TPA for quantification of transporters and enzymes in human liver samples within the same LC-MS/MS runs. We show that TPA is a convenient alternative to SIL-based methods. Optimization of the sample preparation beyond commonly used single tryptic digestion, by adding consecutive cleavage steps, improves accuracy and reproducibility of the TPA method to a level, which is achievable by analysis using stable isotope-labeled standard spiking.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Lytic protease is a 19.8-kDa protein secreted from the Gram-negative bacterium Lysobacter enzymogenes. We have cloned and sequenced the gene for this serine protease. The nucleotide sequence contains an open reading frame which codes for the 198-residue mature enzyme and a potential prepro-peptide, also of 198 residues. The COOH-terminal 49 residues of the pro-peptide are significantly homologous to the propeptides of Streptomyces griseus proteases A and B. We suggest that this pro-peptide region facilitates formation of the active enzyme. A region bridging the NH2-terminal pre- and pro-peptides is homologous to a maize inhibitor of serine proteases. We speculate that this region inhibits enzymatic activity of the prepro-enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Decoy database search with target-decoy competition (TDC) provides an intuitive, easy-to-implement method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with spectrum identifications from shotgun proteomics data. However, the procedure can yield different results for a fixed data set analyzed with different decoy databases, and this decoy-induced variability is particularly problematic for smaller FDR thresholds, data sets, or databases. The average TDC (aTDC) protocol combats this problem by exploiting multiple independently shuffled decoy databases to provide an FDR estimate with reduced variability. We provide a tutorial introduction to aTDC, describe an improved variant of the protocol that offers increased statistical power, and discuss how to deploy aTDC in practice using the Crux software toolkit.",

    "abstract": "In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.",

The aim behind using cRFP is to prevent the contaminant FBS proteins from being misidentified as other proteins in the reference database, just as we would use cRAP (common Repository of Adventitious Proteins) to prevent contaminant proteins present either by accident or through unavoidable contacts from being misidentified as other proteins. We expect it to be widely used in experiments where the proteins are obtained from serum-free media after thorough washing of the cells, or from a complex media such as SILAC, or from extracellular vesicles directly.",

    "abstract": "For the last century we have relied on model organisms to help understand fundamental biological processes. Now, with advancements in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, non-model organisms may be studied with the same advanced bioanalytical toolkit as model organisms. Proteomics is one such technique, which classically relies on predicted protein sequences to catalog and measure complex proteomes across tissues and biofluids. Applying proteomics to non-model organisms can advance and accelerate biomimicry studies, biomedical advancements, veterinary medicine, agricultural research, behavioral ecology, and food safety. In this postmodel organism era, we can study almost any species, meaning that many non-model organisms are, in fact, important emerging model organisms. Herein we specifically focus on eukaryotic organisms and discuss the steps to generate sequence databases, analyze proteomic data with or without a database, and interpret results as well as future research opportunities. Proteomics is more accessible than ever before and will continue to rapidly advance in the coming years, enabling critical research and discoveries in non-model organisms that were hitherto impossible.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an architectural meshwork that surrounds and supports cells. The dysregulation of heavily post-translationally modified ECM proteins directly contributes to various diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is an ideal tool to identify ECM proteins and characterize their post-translational modifications, but ECM proteomics remains challenging owing to the extremely low solubility of the ECM. Herein, enabled by effective solubilization of ECM proteins using our recently developed photocleavable surfactant, Azo, we have developed a streamlined ECM proteomic strategy that allows fast tissue decellularization, efficient extraction and enrichment of ECM proteins, and rapid digestion prior to reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-MS analysis. A total of 173 and 225 unique ECM proteins from mouse mammary tumors have been identified using 1D and 2D RPLC-MS/MS, respectively. Moreover, 87 (from 1DLC-MS/MS) and 229 (from 2DLC-MS/MS) post-translational modifications of ECM proteins, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and hydroxylation, were identified and localized. This Azo-enabled ECM proteomics strategy will streamline the analysis of ECM proteins and promote the study of ECM biology.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is routinely used to identify, characterize, and quantify biological molecules. For protein analysis, MS-based workflows can be broadly categorized as top-down or bottom-up, depending on whether the proteins are analyzed as intact molecules or first digested into peptides. This article outlines steps for preparing peptide samples for MS as part of a bottom-up proteomics workflow, providing versatile methods suitable for discovery and targeted analyses in qualitative and quantitative workflows. Resulting samples contain peptides of suitable size for analysis by MS instrumentation generally available to modern research laboratories, including MS coupled to either liquid chromatography (LC) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) interfaces. This article incorporates recent developments in methodologies and consumables to facilitate sample preparation. The protocols are well-suited to users without prior experience in proteomics and include methods for universally applicable suspension trap processing and for alternate in-solution processing to accommodate a range of sample types.

    "abstract": "Lyophilization is a cost-effective method for biological specimen preservation but detailed tissue-specific reference protocols are still lacking. Moreover, data are limited on the long-term stability of proteins and nucleic acids in lyophilized samples.Here, we offer lyophilization protocols for various rat and mouse tissues (kidney, heart, liver, lung, aorta, and skin) coupled with technical hints for optimal sample preparation. We demonstrate that lyophilized samples stored at 4 °C for 20 months can yield protein and RNA of similar quantity and quality to -80 °C storage, while phosphorylated proteins are preserved as well. Freeze-dried and subsequently pulverized samples can provide more consistent, more reliable data especially when investigating focal injuries, such as fibrosis. We developed a protocol for the concentration of biological solutions and achieved 20-times concentration in human peritoneal dialysis effluent solution which enables the previously unattainable detection of proteins in these samples. We established a method for water removal as well as accurate water content measurement of fecal samples, which can be valuable for gut metabolome analysis.Taken together, lyophilization is a valuable tool for the preservation of biological samples with many advantages. We aim to draw attention to the wide range of possibilities offered by freeze drying in pre-clinical or basic research.",

    "abstract": "The standard proteomics database search strategy involves searching spectra against a peptide database and estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of the resulting set of peptide-spectrum matches. One assumption of this protocol is that all the peptides in the database are relevant to the hypothesis being investigated. However, in settings where researchers are interested in a subset of peptides, alternative search and FDR control strategies are needed. Recently, two methods were proposed to address this problem: subset-search and all-sub. We show that both methods fail to control the FDR. For subset-search, this failure is due to the presence of \"neighbor\" peptides, which are defined as irrelevant peptides with a similar precursor mass and fragmentation spectrum as a relevant peptide. Not considering neighbors compromises the FDR estimate because a spectrum generated by an irrelevant peptide can incorrectly match well to a relevant peptide. Therefore, we have developed a new method, \"subset-neighbor search\" (SNS), that accounts for neighbor peptides. We show evidence that SNS controls the FDR when neighbors are present and that SNS outperforms group-FDR, the only other method that appears to control the FDR relative to a subset of relevant peptides.",
