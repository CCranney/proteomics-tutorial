Here we report the development and application of multiplexed single cell proteomics using trapped ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry. When employing a carrier channel to improve peptide signal, this method allows over 40,000 tandem mass spectra to be acquired in 30 min. Using a KRAS<jats:sup>G12C</jats:sup> model human-derived cell line, we demonstrate the quantification of over 1200 proteins per cell with high relative sequence coverage permitting the detection of multiple classes of post-translational modifications in single cells. When cells were treated with a KRAS<jats:sup>G12C</jats:sup> covalent inhibitor, this approach revealed cell-to-cell variability in the impact of the drug, providing insight missed by traditional proteomics. We provide multiple resources necessary for the application of single cell proteomics to drug treatment studies including tools to reduce cell cycle linked proteomic effects from masking pharmacological phenotypes.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Determining the site of a regulatory phosphorylation event is often essential for elucidating specific kinase–substrate relationships, providing a handle for understanding essential signaling pathways and ultimately allowing insights into numerous disease pathologies. Despite intense research efforts to elucidate mechanisms of protein phosphorylation regulation, efficient, large-scale identification and characterization of phosphorylation sites remains an unsolved problem. In this report we describe an application of existing technology for the isolation and identification of phosphorylation sites. By using a strategy based on strong cation exchange chromatography, phosphopeptides were enriched from the nuclear fraction of HeLa cell lysate. From 967 proteins, 2,002 phosphorylation sites were determined by tandem MS. This unprecedented large collection of sites permitted a detailed accounting of known and unknown kinase motifs and substrates.</jats:p>",

Due to its flexible design, it supports analysis of label-free, data-dependent, data-independent and targeted proteomics datasets. protti can be run on the output of any search engine and software package commonly used for bottom-up proteomics experiments such as Spectronaut, Skyline, MaxQuant or Proteome Discoverer, adequately exported to table format.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>protti is implemented as an open-source R package. Release versions are available via CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=protti) and work on all major operating systems. The development version is maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/jpquast/protti). Full documentation including examples is provided in the form of vignettes on our package website (jpquast.github.io/protti/).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

There are more than 400 different types of PTMs affecting many aspects of protein functions. Such modifications happen as crucial molecular regulatory mechanisms to regulate diverse cellular processes. These processes have a significant impact on the structure and function of proteins. Disruption in PTMs can lead to the dysfunction of vital biological processes and hence to various diseases. High-throughput experimental methods for discovery of PTMs are very laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for computational methods and powerful tools to predict PTMs. There are vast amounts of PTMs data, which are publicly accessible through many online databases. In this survey, we comprehensively reviewed the major online databases and related tools. The current challenges of computational methods were reviewed in detail as well.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In common with other omics technologies, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics produces ever-increasing amounts of raw data, making their efficient analysis a principal challenge. There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is constantly challenged by the presence of contaminant background signals. In particular, protein contaminants from reagents and sample handling are often abundant and almost impossible to avoid. For data-dependent acquisition (DDA) proteomics, exclusion list can be used to reduce the influence of protein contaminants. However, protein contamination has not been evaluated and is rarely addressed in data-independent acquisition (DIA). How protein contaminants influence proteomics data is also unclear. In this study, we established protein contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries that are applicable to all proteomic workflows and evaluated the impact of protein contaminants on both DDA and DIA proteomics. We demonstrated that including our contaminant libraries can reduce false discoveries and increase protein identifications, without influencing the quantification accuracy in various proteomic software platforms. With the pressing need to standardize proteomic workflow in the research community, we highly recommend including our contaminant FASTA and spectral libraries in all bottom-up proteomics workflow. Our contaminant libraries and a step-by-step tutorial to incorporate these libraries in different DDA and DIA data analysis platforms can be valuable resources for proteomics researchers, which are freely accessible at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib\">https://github.com/HaoGroup-ProtContLib</jats:ext-link>.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions fail to form a stable structure, yet they exhibit biological activities. Their mobile flexibility and structural instability are encoded by their amino acid sequences. They recognize proteins, nucleic acids, and other types of partners; they accelerate interactions and chemical reactions between bound partners; and they help accommodate posttranslational modifications, alternative splicing, protein fusions, and insertions or deletions. Overall, IDP-associated biological activities complement those of structured proteins. Recently, there has been an explosion of studies on IDP regions and their functions, yet the discovery and investigation of these proteins have a long, mostly ignored history. Along with recent discoveries, we present several early examples and the mechanisms by which IDPs contribute to function, which we hope will encourage comprehensive discussion of IDPs and IDP regions in biochemistry textbooks. Finally, we propose future directions for IDP research. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> An accurate mass and time (AMT) tag approach for proteomic analyses has been developed over the past several years to facilitate comprehensive high-throughput proteomic measurements. An AMT tag database for an organism, tissue, or cell line is established by initially performing standard shotgun proteomic analysis and, most importantly, by validating peptide identifications using the mass measurement accuracy of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography (LC) elution time constraint. Creation of an AMT tag database largely obviates the need for subsequent MS/MS analyses, and thus facilitates high-throughput analyses. The strength of this technology resides in the ability to achieve highly efficient and reproducible one-dimensional reversed-phased LC separations in conjunction with highly accurate mass measurements using FTICR MS. Recent improvements allow for the analysis of as little as picrogram amounts of proteome samples by minimizing sample handling and maximizing peptide recovery. The nanoproteomics platform has also demonstrated the ability to detect &gt;10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> differences in protein abundances and identify more abundant proteins from subpicogram amounts of samples. The AMT tag approach is poised to become a new standard technique for the in-depth and high-throughput analysis of complex organisms and clinical samples, with the potential to extend the analysis to a single mammalian cell. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Earlier this year we published a method article aimed at optimising protein extraction from mature buds of medicinal cannabis for trypsin-based shotgun proteomics (Vincent, D., et al. Molecules 2019, 24, 659). We then developed a top-down proteomics (TDP) method (Vincent, D., et al. Proteomes 2019, 7, 33). This follow-up study aims at optimising the digestion of medicinal cannabis proteins for identification purposes by bottom-up and middle-down proteomics (BUP and MDP). Four proteases, namely a mixture of trypsin/LysC, GluC, and chymotrypsin, which target different amino acids (AAs) and therefore are orthogonal and cleave proteins more or less frequently, were tested both on their own as well as sequentially or pooled, followed by nLC-MS/MS analyses of the peptide digests. Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa) was used as a control of digestion efficiency. With this multiple protease strategy, BSA was reproducibly 97% sequenced, with peptides ranging from 0.7 to 6.4 kD containing 5 to 54 AA residues with 0 to 6 miscleavages. The proteome of mature apical buds from medicinal cannabis was explored more in depth with the identification of 27,123 peptides matching 494 unique accessions corresponding to 229 unique proteins from Cannabis sativa and close relatives, including 130 (57%) additional annotations when the list is compared to that of our previous BUP study (Vincent, D., et al. Molecules 2019, 24, 659). Almost half of the medicinal cannabis proteins were identified with 100% sequence coverage, with peptides composed of 7 to 91 AA residues with up to 9 miscleavages and ranging from 0.6 to 10 kDa, thus falling into the MDP domain. Many post-translational modifications (PTMs) were identified, such as oxidation, phosphorylations, and N-terminus acetylations. This method will pave the way for deeper proteome exploration of the reproductive organs of medicinal cannabis, and therefore for molecular phenotyping within breeding programs.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

This has resulted in a perceived increase in sensitivity and accuracy with the advent of new techniques. The present review considers these advances with emphasis on the potential use of such technologies in the assay of biopharmaceuticals. The techniques reviewed include Coomassie Blue G-250 dye binding (the Bradford assay), the Lowry assay, the bicinchoninic acid assay and the biuret assay. It is shown that each assay has advantages and disadvantages relative to sensitivity, ease of performance, acceptance in the literature, accuracy and reproducibility/coefficient of variation/laboratory-to-laboratory variation. A comparison of the use of several assays with the same sample population is presented. It is suggested that the most critical issue in the use of a chromogenic protein assay for the characterization of a biopharmaceutical is the selection of a standard for the calibration of the assay; it is crucial that the standard be representative of the sample. If it is not possible to match the standard with the sample from the perspective of protein composition, then it is preferable to use an assay that is not sensitive to the composition of the protein such as a micro-Kjeldahl technique, quantitative amino acid analysis or the biuret assay. In a complex mixture it might be inappropriate to focus on a general method of protein determination and much more informative to use specific methods relating to the protein(s) of particular interest, using either specific assays or antibody-based methods. The key point is that whatever method is adopted as the 'gold standard' for a given protein, this method needs to be used routinely for calibration.",

    "abstract": "Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus produces a virulence factor, protein A (SpA), that contains five homologous Ig-binding domains. The interactions of SpA with the Fab region of membrane-anchored Igs can stimulate a large fraction of B cells, contributing to lymphocyte clonal selection. To understand the molecular basis for this activity, we have solved the crystal structure of the complex between domain D of SpA and the Fab fragment of a human IgM antibody to 2.7-A resolution. In the complex, helices II and III of domain D interact with the variable region of the Fab heavy chain (V(H)) through framework residues, without the involvement of the hypervariable regions implicated in antigen recognition. The contact residues are highly conserved in human V(H)3 antibodies but not in other families. The contact residues from domain D also are conserved among all SpA Ig-binding domains, suggesting that each could bind in a similar manner. Features of this interaction parallel those reported for staphylococcal enterotoxins that are superantigens for many T cells. The structural homology between Ig V(H) regions and the T-cell receptor V(beta) regions facilitates their comparison, and both types of interactions involve lymphocyte receptor surface remote from the antigen binding site. However, T-cell superantigens reportedly interact through hydrogen bonds with T-cell receptor V(beta) backbone atoms in a primary sequence-independent manner, whereas SpA relies on a sequence-restricted conformational binding with residue side chains, suggesting that this common bacterial pathogen has adopted distinct molecular recognition strategies for affecting large sets of B and T lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "Dye-ligands have been considered as one of the important alternatives to natural counterparts for specific affinity chromatography. Dye-ligands are able to bind most types of proteins, in some cases in a remarkably specific manner. They are commercially available, inexpensive, and can easily be immobilized, especially on matrices bearing hydroxyl groups. Although dyes are all synthetic in nature, they are still classified as affinity ligands because they interact with the active sites of many proteins mimicking the structure of the substrates, cofactors, or binding agents for those proteins. A number of textile dyes, known as reactive dyes, have been used for protein purification. Most of these reactive dyes consist of a chromophore (either azo dyes, anthraquinone, or phathalocyanine), linked to a reactive group (often a mono- or dichlorotriazine ring). The interaction between the dye ligand and proteins can be by complex combination of electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding. Selection of the supporting matrix is the first important consideration in dye-affinity systems. There are several methods for immobilization of dye molecules onto the support matrix, in which usually several intermediate steps are followed. Both the adsorption and elution steps should carefully be optimized/designed for a successful separation. Dye-affinity systems in the form of spherical sorbents or as affinity membranes have been used in protein separation.",

    "abstract": "Studies on gastric digestion during 1820-1840 led to the discovery of pepsin as the agent which, in the presence of stomach acid, causes the dissolution of nutrients such as meat or coagulated egg white. Soon afterward it was shown that these protein nutrients were cleaved by pepsin to diffusible products named peptones. Efforts to isolate and purify pepsin were spurred by its widespread adoption for the treatment of digestive disorders, and highly active preparations were available by the end of the nineteenth century. There was uncertainty, however, as to the chemical nature of pepsin, for some preparations exhibited the properties of proteins while other preparations failed to do so. The question was not settled until after 1930, when Northrop crystallized swine pepsin and provided convincing evidence for its identity as a protein. The availability of this purified pepsin during the 1930s also led to the discovery of the first synthetic peptide substrates for pepsin, thus providing needed evidence for the peptide structure of native proteins, a matter of debate at that time. After 1945, with the introduction of new separation methods, notably chromatography and electrophoresis, and the availability of specific proteinases, the amino acid sequences of many proteins, including pepsin and its precursor pepsinogen, were determined. Moreover, treatment of pepsin with chemical reagents indicated the participation in the catalytic mechanism of two aspartyl units widely separated in the linear sequence. Studies on the kinetics of pepsin action on long chain synthetic peptides suggested that the catalytic site was an extended structure. Similar properties were found for other \"aspartyl proteinases,\" such as chymosin (used in cheese making), some intracellular proteinases (cathepsins), and plant proteinases. After 1975, the three-dimensional structures of pepsin and many of its relatives were determined by means of x-ray diffraction techniques, greatly extending our insight into the mechanism of the catalytic action of these enzymes. That knowledge has led to the design of new inhibitors of aspartyl proteinases, which are participants in the maturation of human immunodeficiency virus and in the generation of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The determination of disulfide bonds is an important aspect of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the chemical structure of a protein. The basic strategy for obtaining this information involves the identification of disulfide-linked peptides in digests of proteins and the characterization of their half-cystinyl peptide constituents. Tools for disulfide bond analysis have improved dramatically in the past two decades, especially in terms of speed and sensitivity. This improvement is largely due to the development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), and complementary analyzers with high resolution and accuracy. The process of pairing half-cystinyl peptides is now generally achieved by comparing masses of non-reduced and reduced aliquots of a digest of a protein that was proteolyzed with intact disulfide bonds. Pepsin has favorable properties for generating disulfide-linked peptides, including its acidic pH optimum, at which disulfide bond rearrangement is precluded and protein conformations are likely to be unfolded and accessible to cleavage, and broad substrate specificity. These properties potentiate cleavage between all half-cystine residues of the substrate protein. However, pepsin produces complex digests that contain overlapping peptides due to ragged cleavage. This complexity can produce very complex spectra and/or hamper the ionization of some constituent peptides. It may also be more difficult to compute which half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest are disulfide-linked in non-reduced peptic digests. This ambiguity is offset to some extent by sequence tags that may arise from ragged cleavages and aid sequence assignments. Problems associated with pepsin cleavage can be minimized by digestion in solvents that contain 50% H(2) (18)O. Resultant disulfide-linked peptides have distinct isotope profiles (combinations of isotope ratios and average mass increases) compared to the same peptides with only (16)O in their terminal carboxylates. Thus, it is possible to identify disulfide-linked peptides in digests and chromatographic fractions, using these mass-specific markers, and to rationalize mass changes upon reduction in terms of half-cystinyl sequences of the protein of interest. Some peptides may require additional cleavages due to their multiple disulfide bond contents and/or tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine linkages. Interpretation of the MS/MS spectra of peptides with multiple disulfides in supplementary digests is also facilitated by the presence of (18)O in their terminal carboxylates.",

This approach was evaluated with the glycoprotein, tissue plasminogen activator, t-PA and gave enhanced sequence coverage, compared with a single enzymatic digest. The approach was then evaluated with a complex proteomic sample, namely plasma. It was found that trypsin and Lys-C were able to detect overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and a digital recombination of the data gave a significant increase in both the number of protein identifications as well as an increase in the number of peptides identified per protein (which improves the certainty of the assignment).",

    "abstract": "We developed a sensitive fluorescence assay for the quantitation of proteins in solution using the NanoOrange reagent, a merocyanine dye that produces a large increase in fluorescence quantum yield upon interaction with detergent-coated proteins. The NanoOrange assay allowed for the detection of 10 ng/mL to 10 micrograms/mL protein with a standard fluorometer, offering a broad, dynamic quantitation range and improved sensitivity relative to absorption-based protein solution assays. The protein-to-protein variability of the NanoOrange assay was comparable to those of standard assays, including Lowry, bicinchoninic acid, and Bradford procedures. We also found that the NanoOrange assay is useful for detecting relatively small proteins or large peptides, such as aprotinin and insulin. The assay was somewhat sensitive to the presence of several common contaminants found in protein preparations such as salts and detergents; however, it was insensitive to the presence of reducing agents, nucleic acids, and free amino acids. The simple assay protocol is suitable for automation. Samples are briefly heated in the presence of dye in a detergent-containing diluent, allowed to cool to room temperature, and fluorescence is measured using 485-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths. Therefore, the NanoOrange assay is well suited for use with standard fluorescence microplate readers, fluorometers, and some laser scanners.",

    "abstract": "To provide the scientific community with a single, centralized, authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information, the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities have united to form the Universal Protein Knowledgebase (UniProt) consortium. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and query interfaces. The central database will have two sections, corresponding to the familiar Swiss-Prot (fully manually curated entries) and TrEMBL (enriched with automated classification, annotation and extensive cross-references). For convenient sequence searches, UniProt also provides several non-redundant sequence databases. The UniProt NREF (UniRef) databases provide representative subsets of the knowledgebase suitable for efficient searching. The comprehensive UniProt Archive (UniParc) is updated daily from many public source databases. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). The scientific community is encouraged to submit data for inclusion in UniProt.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasensitive nanoscale proteomics approaches for characterizing proteins from complex proteomic samples of <50 ng of total mass are described. Protein identifications from 0.5 pg of whole proteome extracts were enabled by ultrahigh sensitivity (<75 zmol for individual proteins) achieved using high-efficiency (peak capacities of approximately 10(3)) 15-microm-i.d. capillary liquid chromatography separations (i.e., using nanoLC, approximately 20 nL/min mobile-phase flow rate at the optimal linear velocity of approximately 0.2 cm/s) coupled on-line with a micro-solid-phase sample extraction and a nanoscale electrospray ionization interface to a 11.4-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (MS). Proteome measurement coverage improved as sample size was increased from as little as 0.5 pg of sample. It was found that a 2.5-ng sample provided 14% coverage of all annotated open reading frames for the microorganism Deinococcus radiodurans, consistent with previous results for a specific culture condition. The estimated detection dynamic range for detected proteins was 10(5)-10(6). An improved accurate mass and LC elution time two-dimensional data analysis methodology, used to both speed and increase the confidence of peptide/protein identifications, enabled identification of 872 proteins/run from a single 3-h nanoLC/FTICR MS analysis. The low-zeptomole-level sensitivity provides a basis for extending proteomics studies to smaller cell populations and potentially to a single mammalian cell. Application with ion trap MS/MS instrumentation allowed protein identification from 50 pg (total mass) of proteomic samples (i.e., approximately 100 times larger than FTICR MS), corresponding to a sensitivity of approximately 7 amol for individual proteins. Compared with single-stage FTICR measurements, ion trap MS/MS provided a much lower proteome measurement coverage and dynamic range for a given analysis time and sample quantity.",

These reagents may be used to modify proteins in solution, as well as proteins in gel slices, prior to proteolytic digestion and mass spectral analysis. The procedure eliminates several steps with both types of samples. Samples in solution do not need to be desalted following reduction and alkylation, with excess reagent being removed under vacuum. For gel slices, the procedure combines washing, destaining, reduction and alkylation into a single step. The procedure was applied successfully to samples as complex as serum, and we demonstrated alkylation of cysteines to be quantitative in purified proteins. We also were able to reduce and alkylate proteins with these reagents during the gas phase. Elimination of the need for desalting of samples after reaction raised the possibility of automation of the procedure for liquid samples, which is difficult with conventional reduction and alkylation chemistries.",

At the core of this methodology is a multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5' to 3' decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we have developed a high-resolution two-dimensional separation strategy for the analysis of complex peptide mixtures. This methodology employs isoelectric focusing of peptides on immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gels in the first dimension, followed by reversed-phase chromatography in the second dimension, and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The traditional approach to this mixture problem employs strong-cation-exchange (SCX) chromatography in the first dimension. Here, we present a direct comparison of these two first-dimensional techniques using complex protein samples derived from the testis of Rattus norvegicus. It was found that the use of immobilized pH gradients (narrow range pH 3.5-4.5) for peptide separation in the first dimension yielded 13% more protein identifications than the optimized off-line SCX approach (employing the entire pI range of the sample). In addition, the IPG technique allows for a much more efficient use on mass spectrometer analysis time. Separation of a tryptic digest derived from a rat testis sample on a narrow range pH gradient (over the 3.5-4.5 pH range) yielded 7626 and 2750 peptides and proteins, respectively. Peptide and protein identification was performed with high confidence using SEQUEST in combination with a data filtering program employing pI and statistical based functions to remove false-positives from the data.",

Among these reactions, carbonylation has attracted a great deal of attention due to its irreversible and unrepairable nature. Carbonylated proteins are marked for proteolysis by the proteasome and the Lon protease but can escape degradation and form high-molecular-weight aggregates that accumulate with age. Such carbonylated aggregates can become cytotoxic and have been associated with a large number of age-related disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. This review focuses on the generation of and defence against protein carbonyls and speculates on the potential role of carbonylation in protein quality control, cellular deterioration, and senescence.",

    "abstract": "The shotgun proteomic strategy based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry and automated database searching has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in most large scale studies. However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.",

    "abstract": "The need to identify protein or peptide biomarkers via readily available biological samples like serum, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid is often hindered by a few particular proteins present at relatively high concentrations. The ability to remove these proteins specifically, reproducibly, and with high selectivity is increasingly important in proteomic studies, and success in this procedure is leading to an ever-increasing list of lower abundant proteins being identified in these biological fluids. The current work addresses some of the potential problems in depleting proteins in typical biomarker studies, including nonspecific binding during depletion procedures and whether low molecular weight (LMW) species bind to the column in a so-called \"sponge\" effect caused by the ability of albumin or other high-abundant proteins to bind peptides or protein fragments. LC-MS/MS methods were applied to the comparative analysis of an IgG-based immunodepletion method and a Cibacron blue (CB)-dye-based method, for specificity of removing targeted proteins (binding fraction), as well as for assessing efficiency of target removal. This analysis was extended to examine the effects of repeated use of materials (cycles of binding and elution), in order to assess potential for carryover of one sample to the next. Capacity studies and efficiency of protein removal from the serum samples were followed for the IgG-based system using both immunochemical assays (ELISA) as well as LC-MS/MS methods. Additionally, the IgG-based system was further characterized for the removal of LMW polypeptides by nonspecific binding. We conclude that the IgG-based system provided effective removal of targeted proteins, with minimal carryover, high longevity, and minimal nonspecific binding. Significant differences are noted between the depletion techniques employed, and this should be considered based on the expectations set during experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Chaotropic agents are cosolutes that can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network between water molecules and reduce the stability of the native state of proteins by weakening the hydrophobic effect. In this work, we represent the chaotropic agent as a factor that reduces the amount of order in the structures formed by water molecules, both in the bulk and the hydration shells around hydrophobic amino acids. In this framework we show that low chaotrope concentrations lead to a destabilization of the native state of proteins, and that high concentrations induce complete denaturation. We also find that the reduction of the number of bulk ordered states of water molecules can give origin to an effective interaction between chaotropic molecules and proteins.",

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography is a useful tool for proteome analysis, providing a greater peak capacity than single-dimensional LC. The most popular 2D-HPLC approach used today for proteomic research combines strong cation exchange and reversed-phase HPLC. We have evaluated an alternative mode for 2D-HPLC of peptides, employing reversed-phase columns in both separation dimensions. The orthogonality of 2D separation was investigated for selected types of RP stationary phases, ion-pairing agents and mobile phase pH. The pH appears to have the most significant impact on the RP-LC separation selectivity; the greatest orthogonality was achieved for the system with C18 columns using pH 10 in the first and pH 2.6 in the second LC dimension. Separation was performed in off-line mode with partial fraction evaporation. The achievable peak capacity in RP-RP-HPLC and overall performance compares favorably to SCX-RP-HPLC and holds promise for proteomic analysis.",

This paper illustrates the effectiveness of OFFGEL electrophoresis with the Agilent 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator for the fractionation of peptides. An Escherichia coli tryptic digest was separated in 24 fractions, and peptides were identified by reversed-phase liquid chromatography on a microfluidic device with mass spectrometric detection. About 90% of the identified individual peptides were found in only one or two fractions. The distribution of the calculated isoelectric points for the peptides identified in each fraction was especially narrow in the acidic pH range. Standard deviations approached the size of the pH segment covered by the respective fraction. The experimental peptide isoelectric point measured by OFFGEL electrophoresis was used as an additional filter for validation of peptide identifications.",

    "abstract": "Detergents have been widely used for the solubilization of membrane proteins and the improvement of their digestion. In this paper, we have evaluated the application of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) to the solubilization and digestion of rat hippocampal plasma membrane (PM) proteins. For in-solution digestion, rat hippocampal PM fraction from sucrose-density gradient centrifugation was solubilized by boiling in 1.0% SDC, and directly digested without dilution. During the in-gel digestion of the hippocampal PM proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, 0.1% SDC was added. Before analysis of peptide mixture by liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry, SDC in the tryptic digests was removed by centrifugation following acidification. Use of 1.0% SDC in solubilization and in-solution digestion of rat PM proteins had led to 77 PM or membrane-associated proteins identified, a more than 2-fold increase over that by use of SDS. The addition of 0.1% SDC to the in-gel digestion of SDS-PAGE-resolved membrane proteins remarkably enhanced the coverage of tryptic peptides and the number of hydrophobic membrane proteins identified. Being a cheaper and more tractable acid-insoluble detergent, SDC could be used at higher concentration in the solubilization and tryptic digestion of proteins including PM proteins with the purpose of enhancing the protein solubility and at the same time making no interference with trypsin activity and subsequent analyses.",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Following on our recent work, on-line one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) porous layer open tubular/liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PLOT/LC-ESI-MS) platforms using 3.2 mx10 microm i.d. poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) PLOT columns have been developed to provide robust, high-performance, and ultrasensitive proteomic analysis. With the use of a PicoClear tee, the dead volume connection between a 50 microm i.d. PS-DVB monolithic micro-SPE column and the PLOT column was minimized. The micro-SPE/PLOT column assembly provided a separation performance similar to that obtained with direct injection onto the PLOT column at a mobile phase flow rate of 20 nL/min. The trace analysis potential of the platform was evaluated using an in-gel tryptic digest sample of a gel fraction (15-40 kDa) of a cervical cancer (SiHa) cell line. As an example of the sensitivity of the system, approximately 2.5 ng of protein in 2 microL of solution, an amount corresponding to 20 SiHa cells, was subjected to on-line micro-SPE-PLOT/LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis using a linear ion trap MS. A total of 237 peptides associated with 163 unique proteins were identified from a single analysis when using stringent criteria associated with a false positive rate of less than 1%. The number of identified peptides and proteins increased to 638 and 343, respectively, as the injection amount was raised to approximately 45 ng of protein, an amount corresponding to 350 SiHa cells. In comparison, only 338 peptides and 231 unique proteins were identified (false positive rate again less than 1%) from 750 ng of protein from the identical gel fraction, an amount corresponding to 6000 SiHa cells, using a typical 15 cmx75 microm i.d. packed capillary column. The greater sensitivity, higher recovery, and higher resolving power of the PLOT column resulted in the increased number of identifications from only approximately 5% of the injected sample amount. The resolving power of the micro-SPE/PLOT assembly was further extended by 2D chromatography via combination of the high-efficiency reversed-phase PLOT column with strong cation-exchange chromatography (SCX). As an example, 1071 peptides associated with 536 unique proteins were identified from 75 ng of protein from the same gel fraction, an amount corresponding to 600 cells, using five ion-exchange fractions in on-line 2D SCX-PLOT/LC-MS. The 2D system, implemented in an automated format, led to simple and robust operation for proteomic analysis. These promising results demonstrate the potential of the PLOT column for ultratrace analysis.",

    "abstract": "Several label-free quantitation strategies have been introduced that obliterate the need for expensive isotopically labeled molecules. However label-free approaches have considerably higher demands in respect of repeatability of sample preparation and fractionation than multiplexing isotope labeling-based strategies. OFFGEL fractionation promises the necessary separation efficiency and repeatability. To test this platform, 12-fraction peptide OFFGEL electrophoresis and online reversed-phase LC connected to a quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer were used to determine differences of the physiological, pathological and biochemical distinct extraocular muscle allotype in comparison to hind-limb muscle. Close to 70% of the peptides separated by OFFGEL electrophoresis were detected only in a single fraction. To determine the separation repeatability of four samples, we compared the ion volumes of multiple peptides deriving from the thick filament-associated protein titin over several fractions and determined a coefficient of variation below 20%. Of the 474 proteins identified, 61 proteins were differently expressed between the two muscle allotypes and were involved in metabolism, muscle contraction, stress response, or gene expression. Several expression differences were validated using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. We therefore consider peptide OFFGEL fractionation an effective and efficient addition to our label-free quantitative proteomics workflow.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new protocol for digesting hydrophobic proteins using trypsin with the aid of phase-transfer surfactants (PTS), such as sodium deoxycholate (SDC). SDC increases the solubility of hydrophobic proteins, enhances the activity of trypsin, and improves the accessibility to trypsin of proteins denatured during the extraction process. After digestion, SDC was successfully removed from the acidified solution containing tryptic peptides by adding a water-immiscible organic solvent, into which SDC was predominantly transferred, while the digested peptides remained in the aqueous phase. Compared with a protocol using an acid-labile surfactant, this PTS protocol increased the number of identified proteins and the recovery of hydrophobic peptides in the analysis of 400 ng of a membrane-enriched fraction of Escherichia coli. Application of the PTS protocol to 9.0 microg of a membrane-enriched pellet from human cervical cancer HeLa cells resulted in identification of a total of 1450 proteins, of which 764 (53%) were membrane proteins, by two-dimensional strong cation exchange (SCX)-C18 LC-MSMS with 5 SCX fractions. The distribution of the number of transmembrane domains in proteins identified in this study was in agreement with that in the IPI human database, suggesting that the PTS protocol can provide unbiased digestion of the membrane proteome.",

    "abstract": "In proteomics, nanoflow multidimensional chromatography is now the gold standard for the separation of complex mixtures of peptides as generated by in-solution digestion of whole-cell lysates. Ideally, the different stationary phases used in multidimensional chromatography should provide orthogonal separation characteristics. For this reason, the combination of strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) and reversed-phase (RP) chromatography is the most widely used combination for the separation of peptides. Here, we review the potential of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) as a separation tool in the multidimensional separation of peptides in proteomics applications. Recent work has revealed that HILIC may provide an excellent alternative to SCX, possessing several advantages in the area of separation power and targeted analysis of protein post-translational modifications.

    "abstract": "Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is becoming increasingly popular for separation of polar samples on polar columns in aqueous-organic mobile phases rich in organic solvents (usually ACN). Silica gel with decreased surface concentration of silanol groups, or with chemically bonded amino-, amido-, cyano-, carbamate-, diol-, polyol-, or zwitterionic sulfobetaine ligands are used as the stationary phases for HILIC separations, in addition to the original poly(2-sulphoethyl aspartamide) strong cation-exchange HILIC material. The type of the stationary and the composition of the mobile phase play important roles in the mixed-mode HILIC retention mechanism and can be flexibly tuned to suit specific separation problems. Because of excellent mobile phase compatibility and complementary selectivity to RP chromatography, HILIC is ideally suited for highly orthogonal 2-D LC-LC separations of complex samples containing polar compounds, such as peptides, proteins, oligosaccharides, drugs, metabolites and natural compounds. This review attempts to present an overview of the HILIC separation systems, possibilities for their characterization and emerging HILIC applications in 2-D off-line and on-line LC-LC separations of various samples, in combination with RP and other separation modes.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the protein composition of complex extracts or discovering biologically relevant polypeptides is frequently hindered by large dynamic concentration ranges. The presence of high-abundance proteins suppresses the signal of low-abundance ones, and the most rare proteins are frequently below the sensitivity of available analytical methods. This protocol addresses this problem by using highly diversified hexapeptide ligand libraries for capturing proteins. A protein extract is mixed with the library and because the library has equal amounts of each ligand, theoretically the maximum amount of each protein bound is the same. Under overloading conditions this has the effect of diluting those proteins present in excess of the ligand concentration and concentrating those of relatively lower abundance. Unbound components are washed out and captured species are finally desorbed. The entire sample treatment process takes about half a day and yields a protein solution that could be used as such for mass spectrometry investigations.",

Knowledge of identity enables their use as internal calibrants for accurate mass measurements. This review/tutorial summarizes current literature on reported contaminants and introduces a number of novel interferences that have been observed and identified in our laboratories over the past decade. These include both compounds of proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous nature. In the supplemental data a spreadsheet is provided that contains a searchable ion list of all compounds identified to date.",

    "abstract": "Proteomic analysis typically has been performed using proteins digested with trypsin because of the excellent fragmentation patterns they produce in collision induced dissociation (CID). For analyses in which high protein coverage is desirable, such as global monitoring of post-translational modifications, additional sequences can be seen using parallel digestion with a second enzyme. We have benchmarked a relatively obscure basidomycete-derived zinc metalloendopeptidase, Lys-N, that selectively cleaves the amide bond N-terminal of lysine residues. We have found that Lys-N digestion yields peptides with easily assigned CID spectra. Using a mixture of purified proteins as well as a complex yeast lysate, we have shown that Lys-N efficiently digests all proteins at the predicted sites of cleavage. Shotgun proteomics analyses of Lys-N digests of both the standard mixture and yeast lysate yielded peptide and protein identification numbers that were generally comparable to trypsin digestion, whereas the combination data from Lys-N and trypsin digestion substantially enhanced protein coverage. During CID fragmentation, the additional amino terminal basicity enhanced b-ion intensity which was reflected in long b-ion tags that were particularly pronounced during CID in a quadrupole. Finally, immonium ion peaks produced from Lys-N digested peptides originate from the carboxy terminus in contrast to tryptic peptides where immonium ions originate from the amino terminus.",

    "abstract": "Depletion of high-abundance proteins is regarded as a critical sample preparation step for most plasma proteomic analyses and profiling strategies. This report describes a process that rapidly and reproducibly precipitates high-abundance disulfide-rich proteins, including albumin and transferrin, from serum and plasma. A low volume of concentrated reducing agent, viz. dithiothreitol (DTT) or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), was added directly to plasma followed by a brief incubation at ambient temperature. Removal of the precipitate via centrifugation and identification of the protein content revealed an albumin-enriched pellet. Direct analysis of the supernatant by MALDI-TOF-MS afforded peptidome and small protein profiles with enhanced features and minimal ionization of full-length albumin. The reproducible and quantitative nature of the method has been demonstrated by monitoring the plasma levels of an antiangiogenic protein biologic, rKringle5 (rK5). The 10.5-kDa analyte was only reliably detected in plasma after treatment with reducing agent, ionizing linearly from 150 to 1200 fmol (on-target) with a mean CV of 7%. This method distinguishes itself from immunoaffinity resin-based approaches since it can be scaled to large milliliter quantities and it is compatible with plasma from all species tested.",

    "abstract": "A method is described for the preparation of a crystalline protein from commercial pepsin preparations which has powerful peptic activity. The composition, optical activity, and proteolytic activity of this protein remain constant through seven successive crystallizations. No evidence for the presence of a mixture or of a solid solution is found in a study of the solubility of the protein in a series of different salt solutions, nor from the diffusion coefficient or from the rate of inactivation. These results indicate that the material is a pure substance or possibly a solid solution of two or more substances having nearly the same solubility in all the various solvents studied. It seems reasonable to conclude from these experiments that the possibility of a mixture must be limited to a mixture of proteins, so that the conclusion seems justified that pepsin itself is a protein.",

    "abstract": "Prior to embarking upon the purification of a protein, one should begin by considering what the protein is to be used for. In particular, how much of the protein is needed, what should be its state of purity, and must it be folded correctly and associated with various other peptides or cofactors. Using such criteria, an appropriate assay should be chosen and a procedure be planned taking into account the source of the protein, how it is to be extracted from the source, and what agents the protein ought to be exposed to or ultimately be stored in. One is often surprised at the time necessary to develop an appropriate protein purification procedure relative to the time required to clone a gene or to accumulate information with the purified protein. There are an overwhelming number of options for protein purification steps, so forethought is necessary to expedite the tedious job of developing the purification scheme, or to avoid having to redesign it upon attempting to use the protein. This chapter points out general considerations to be undertaken in designing, organizing, and executing the purification, while subsequent chapters of this volume supply more specific options and technical details.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is an important technique for analyzing proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.",

    "abstract": "The FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase plays an important role in normal hematopoietic development and leukemogenesis. Point mutations within the activation loop and in-frame tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane domain represent the most frequent molecular abnormalities observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly these gain-of-function mutations correlate with different clinical outcomes, suggesting that signals from constitutive FLT3 mutants activate different downstream targets. In principle, mass spectrometry offers a powerful means to quantify protein phosphorylation and identify signaling events associated with constitutively active kinases or other oncogenic events. However, regulation of individual phosphorylation sites presents a challenging case for proteomics studies whereby quantification is based on individual peptides rather than an average across different peptides derived from the same protein. Here we describe a robust experimental framework and associated error model for iTRAQ-based quantification on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer that relates variance of peptide ratios to mass spectral peak height and provides for assignment of p value, q value, and confidence interval to every peptide identification, all based on routine measurements, obviating the need for detailed characterization of individual ion peaks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model is stable over time and can be applied in a manner directly analogous to ubiquitously used external mass calibration routines. Application of our error model to quantitative proteomics data for FLT3 signaling provides evidence that phosphorylation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 abrogates the transformative potential, but not overall kinase activity, of FLT3-D835Y in acute myeloid leukemia.",

While conventional purification methods such as dialysis, ultrafiltration or protein precipitation often lead to a marked loss of protein, SPE with small-sized particles is a powerful alternative. The implementation of particles with superparamagnetic cores facilitates the handling of those particles and allows the application of particles in the nanometer to low micrometer range. Due to the small diameters, magnetic particles are advantageous for increasing sensitivity when using subsequent MS analysis or gel electrophoresis. In the last years, different types of magnetic particles were developed for specific protein purification purposes followed by analysis or screening procedures using MS or SDS gel electrophoresis. In this review, the use of magnetic particles for different applications, such as, the extraction and analysis of DNA/RNA, peptides and proteins, is described.",

Here we examine the use of multiple proteases (trypsin, LysC, ArgC, AspN, and GluC) to improve both protein identification and characterization in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a data-dependent, decision tree-based algorithm to tailor MS(2) fragmentation method to peptide precursor, we identified 92 095 unique peptides (609 665 total) mapping to 3908 proteins at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). These results were a significant improvement upon data from a single protease digest (trypsin) - 27 822 unique peptides corresponding to 3313 proteins. The additional 595 protein identifications were mainly from those at low abundances (i.e., < 1000 copies/cell); sequence coverage for these proteins was likewise improved nearly 3-fold. We demonstrate that large portions of the proteome are simply inaccessible following digestion with a single protease and that multiple proteases, rather than technical replicates, provide a direct route to increase both protein identifications and proteome sequence coverage.",

DiLeu reagents serve as attractive alternatives for isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass tags (TMTs) due to their synthetic simplicity, labeling efficiency, and improved fragmentation efficiency. DiLeu reagent resembles the general structure of a tandem mass tag in that it contains an amine reactive group (triazine ester) targeting the N-terminus and epsilon-amino group of the lysine side chain of a peptide, a balance group, and a reporter group. A mass shift of 145.1 Da is observed for each incorporated label. Intense a(1) reporter ions at m/z 115.1, 116.1, 117.1, and 118.1 are observed for all pooled samples upon MS(2). All labeling reagents are readily synthesized from commercially available chemicals with greatly reduced cost. Labels 117 and 118 can be synthesized in one step and labels 115 and 116 can be synthesized in two steps. Both DiLeu and iTRAQ reagents show comparable protein sequence coverage (approximately 43%) and quantitation accuracy (<15%) for tryptically digested protein samples. Furthermore, enhanced fragmentation of DiLeu labeling reagents offers greater confidence in protein identification and neuropeptide sequencing from complex neuroendocrine tissue extracts from a marine model organism, Callinectes sapidus.",

    "abstract": "Peptide labeling with isobaric tags has become a popular technique in quantitative shotgun proteomics. Using two different samples viz. a protein mixture and HeLa extracts, we show that three commercially available isobaric tags differ with regard to peptide identification rates: The number of identified proteins and peptides was largest with iTRAQ 4-plex, followed by TMT 6-plex, and smallest with iTRAQ 8-plex. In all experiments, we employed a previously described method where two scans were acquired for each precursor on an LTQ Orbitrap: A CID scan under standard settings for identification, and a HCD scan for quantification. The observed differences in identification rates were similar when data was searched with either Mascot or Sequest. We consider these findings to be the result of a combination of several factors, most notably prominent ions in CID spectra as a consequence of loss of fragments of the label tag from precursor ions. These fragment ions cannot be explained by current search engines and were observed to have a negative impact on peptide scores.",

    "abstract": "Immunoaffinity depletion with antibodies to the top 7 or top 14 high-abundance plasma proteins is used to enhance detection of lower abundance proteins in both shotgun and targeted proteomic analyses. We evaluated the effects of top 7/top 14 immunodepletion on the shotgun proteomic analysis of human plasma. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of immunodepletion on detection of proteins across detectable ranges of abundance. The depletion columns afforded highly repeatable and efficient plasma protein fractionation. Relatively few nontargeted proteins were captured by the depletion columns. Analyses of unfractionated and immunodepleted plasma by peptide isoelectric focusing (IEF), followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), demonstrated enrichment of nontargeted plasma proteins by an average of 4-fold, as assessed by MS/MS spectral counting. Either top 7 or top 14 immunodepletion resulted in a 25% increase in identified proteins compared to unfractionated plasma. Although 23 low-abundance (<10 ng mL(-1)) plasma proteins were detected, they accounted for only 5-6% of total protein identifications in immunodepleted plasma. In both unfractionated and immunodepleted plasma, the 50 most abundant plasma proteins accounted for 90% of cumulative spectral counts and precursor ion intensities, leaving little capacity to sample lower abundance proteins. Untargeted proteomic analyses using current LC-MS/MS platforms-even with immunodepletion-cannot be expected to efficiently discover low-abundance, disease-specific biomarkers in plasma.",

Peptides labeled with DiART were analyzed using an electrospray ionization (ESI)-based LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Our data showed that (2)H-associated isotope effects, such as partial loss of (2)H labels during tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and (2)H-related chromatographic shift, were either not observed or negligible. With the use of a hybrid collision-induced dissociation (CID)-higher energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) acquisition method, we were able to identify DiART-labeled peptides with high confidence and quantify them with high accuracy. Furthermore, we adopted a hybrid electron-transfer dissociation (ETD)-HCD acquisition protocol and developed a novel data analysis approach to measure phosphorylation of peptides. Our results showed DiART had excellent performance on LTQ-Orbitrap instruments and provided a cost-effective technique for large-scale quantitative proteomics measurements.",

    "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers studies are based on the differential expression of proteins between different treatment groups or between diseased and control populations. Most mass spectrometry-based methods of protein quantitation, however, are based on the detection and quantitation of peptides, not intact proteins. For peptide-based protein quantitation to be accurate, the digestion protocols used in proteomic analyses must be both efficient and reproducible. There have been very few studies, however, where plasma denaturation/digestion protocols have been compared using absolute quantitation methods. In this paper, 14 combinations of heat, solvent [acetonitrile, methanol, trifluoroethanol], chaotropic agents [guanidine hydrochloride, urea], and surfactants [sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium deoxycholate (DOC)] were compared with respect to their effectiveness in improving subsequent tryptic digestion. These digestion protocols were evaluated by quantitating the production of proteotypic tryptic peptides from 45 moderate- to high-abundance plasma proteins, using tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with a mixture of stable-isotope labeled analogues of these proteotypic peptides as internal standards. When the digestion efficiencies of these 14 methods were compared, we found that both of the surfactants (SDS and DOC) produced an increase in the overall yield of tryptic peptides from these 45 proteins, when compared to the more commonly used urea protocol. SDS, however, can be a serious interference for subsequent mass spectrometry. DOC, on the other hand, can be easily removed from the samples by acid precipitation. Examining the results of a reproducibility study, done with 5 replicate digestions, DOC and SDS with a 9 h digestion time produced the highest average digestion efficiencies (∼80%), with the highest average reproducibility (<5% error, defined as the relative deviation from the mean value). However, because of potential interferences resulting from the use of SDS, we recommend DOC with a 9 h digestion procedure as the optimum protocol.",

Full proteome characterization is desired from complex organisms, and with growing interest in post-translational modifications an extended protein sequence coverage is required. Peptide fractionation techniques have the great challenge of feeding current mass spectrometers in a way in which these issues are met. Peptide fractionation can be divided into three simple components: the column characteristics; the mobile phase; and peptide properties (charge, polarity, hydrophobicity and size). The current challenges are in the combination of these three components to allow comprehensive proteomics studies to be improved.",

Disruption of the plasma membrane (PM) by mechanical forces to investigate the content of the cell is common practice. Whether vesicles or membranes of different sources can fuse as a result is unclear. If such contamination occurs, conclusions based on these techniques should consider these. Utilizing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane marker and a PM marker, we were able to detect the source of membranes following the breakup of cells using flow cytometry and immuno Electron Microscopy (immuno EM). Fractionation processes produced a small fraction of new membrane entities from two distinctively different origins generated during the initial disruption steps in a temperature independent manner, stressing that defining organelles or intrinsic fusion events based on such procedures and markers are valid when exceeding the small number of vesicles fused during the fractionation process.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the implementation of various denaturants and their efficacy in bottom-up membrane proteomic methods using LC-MS analysis, microsomes isolated from tomato roots were treated with MS-compatible surfactants (RapiGest SF Surfactant from Waters and PPS Silent Surfactant from Protein Discovery), a chaotropic reagent (guanidine hydrochloride), and an organic solvent (methanol). Peptides were analyzed in triplicate sample and technical replicates by data-independent LC-MS(E) analysis. Overall, 2333 unique peptides matching to 662 unique proteins were detected with the order of denaturant method efficacy being RapiGest SF Surfactant, PPS Silent Surfactant, guanidine hydrochloride, and methanol. Using bioinformatic analysis, 103 proteins were determined to be integral membrane proteins. When normalizing the data as a percentage of the overall number of peptides and proteins identified for each method, the order for integral membrane protein identification efficacy was methanol, guanidine hydrochloride, RapiGest SF Surfactant, and PPS Silent Surfactant. Interestingly, only 8% of the proteins were identified in all four methods with the silent surfactants having the greatest overlap at 17%. GRAVY analysis at the protein and peptide level indicated that methanol and guanidine hydrochloride promoted detection of hydrophobic proteins and peptides, respectively; however, trypsin activity in the presence of each denaturant was determined as a major factor contributing to peptide identification by LC-MS(E) . These results reveal the complementary nature of each denaturant method, which can be used in an integrated approach to provide a more effective bottom-up analysis of membrane proteomes than can be achieved using only a single denaturant.",

    "abstract": "We used deep sequencing technology to profile the transcriptome, gene copy number, and CpG island methylation status simultaneously in eight commonly used breast cell lines to develop a model for how these genomic features are integrated in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative breast cancer. Total mRNA sequence, gene copy number, and genomic CpG island methylation were carried out using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Sequences were mapped to the human genome to obtain digitized gene expression data, DNA copy number in reference to the non-tumor cell line (MCF10A), and methylation status of 21,570 CpG islands to identify differentially expressed genes that were correlated with methylation or copy number changes. These were evaluated in a dataset from 129 primary breast tumors. Gene expression in cell lines was dominated by ER-associated genes. ER+ and ER- cell lines formed two distinct, stable clusters, and 1,873 genes were differentially expressed in the two groups. Part of chromosome 8 was deleted in all ER- cells and part of chromosome 17 amplified in all ER+ cells. These loci encoded 30 genes that were overexpressed in ER+ cells; 9 of these genes were overexpressed in ER+ tumors. We identified 149 differentially expressed genes that exhibited differential methylation of one or more CpG islands within 5 kb of the 5' end of the gene and for which mRNA abundance was inversely correlated with CpG island methylation status. In primary tumors we identified 84 genes that appear to be robust components of the methylation signature that we identified in ER+ cell lines. Our analyses reveal a global pattern of differential CpG island methylation that contributes to the transcriptome landscape of ER+ and ER- breast cancer cells and tumors. The role of gene amplification/deletion appears to more modest, although several potentially significant genes appear to be regulated by copy number aberrations.",

The purpose of this work was to review the options for the characterization of HILIC stationary phases and their applications for separations of polar compounds in complex matrices. The characteristics of the hydrophilic stationary phase may affect and in some cases limit the choices of mobile phase composition, ion strength or buffer pH value available, since mechanisms other than hydrophilic partitioning could potentially occur. Enhancing our understanding of retention behavior in HILIC increases the scope of possible applications of liquid chromatography. One interesting option may also be to use HILIC in orthogonal and/or two-dimensional separations. Bioapplications of HILIC systems are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium sulfate precipitation (ASP) was explored as a method for depleting some highly abundant proteins from blood plasma, in order to reduce the dynamic range of protein concentration and to improve the detection of low abundance proteins by 2D-PAGE. 40% ammonium sulfate saturation was chosen since it allowed depleting 39% albumin and 82% α-1-antitrypsin. ASP-depletion showed high reproducibility in 2D-PAGE analysis (4.2% variation in relative abundance of albumin), similar to that offered by commercial affinity-depletion columns. Besides, it allowed detecting 59 spots per gel, very close to the number of spots detected in immuno-affinity-depleted plasma. Thus, ASP at 40% saturation is a reliable depletion method that may help in proteomic analysis of blood plasma. Finally, ASP-depletion seems to be complementary to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)-depletion, and therefore an ASP-step followed by a HIC-step could probably deplete the most highly abundant plasma proteins, thus improving the detection of low abundance proteins by 2D-PAGE.",

While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms, many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation, because unlike first-generation projects, there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies.",

    "abstract": "Pulsed Q collision-induced dissociation (PQD) was developed in part to facilitate detection of low-mass reporter ions using labeling reagents (e.g. iTRAQ) on LTQ platforms. It has generally been recognized that the scan speed and sensitivity of an LTQ are superior than those of an Orbitrap using the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). However, the use of PQD in quantitative proteomics is limited, primarily due to the meager reproducibility of reporter ion ratios. Optimizations of PQD for iTRAQ quantification using LTQ have been reported, but a universally applicable strategy for quantifying the less abundant proteins has not been fully established. Adjustments of the AGC target, μscan, or scan speed offer only incremental improvements in reproducibility. From our experience, however, satisfactory coefficients of variation (CVs) of reporter ion ratios were difficult to achieve using the discovery-based approach. As an alternative, we implemented a target-based approach that obviates data dependency to allow repetitive data acquisitions across chromatographic peaks. Such a strategy generates enough data points for more reliable quantification. Using cAMP treatment in S49 cell lysates and this target-based approach, we were able to validate differentially expressed proteins, which were initially identified as potential candidates using the discovery-based PQD. The target-based strategy also yielded results comparable to those obtained from HCD in an Orbitrap. Our findings should aid LTQ users who desire to explore iTRAQ quantitative proteomics but have limited access to the more costly Orbitrap or other instruments.",

    "abstract": "Isobaric tags have broad applications in both basic and translational research, as demonstrated by the widely used isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). Recent results from large-scale quantitative proteomics projects, however, indicate that protein quantification by iTRAQ is often biased in complex biological samples. Here, we report the application of another isobaric tag, deuterium isobaric amine reactive tag (DiART), for quantifying the proteome of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (T. tengcongensis), a thermophilic bacterium first discovered in China. We compared the performance of DiART with iTRAQ from several different aspects, including their fragmentation mechanisms, the number of identified proteins, and the accuracy of quantification. Our results revealed that, as compared with iTRAQ, DiART yielded significantly stronger reporter ions, which did not reduce the number of identifiable peptides, but improved the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for quantification. Remarkably, we found that, under identical chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) conditions, DiART exhibited less reporter ions ratio compression than iTRAQ, probably due to more reporter ions with higher intensities produced by DiART labeling. Taken together, we demonstrate that DiART is a valuable alternative of iTRAQ with enhanced performance for quantitative proteomics.",

In this study, we explored stable isotope labeled carbonyl-reactive tandem mass tags (glyco-TMTs) as a novel approach for the quantification of N-linked glycans. Glyco-TMTs bearing hydrazide- and aminooxy-functionalized groups were compared for glycan reducing end derivatization efficiency and quantification merits. Aminooxy TMTs outperform the hydrazide reagents in terms of labeling efficiency (>95% vs 65% at 0.1 μM) and mass spectrometry based quantification using heavy/light-TMT labeled glycans enabled accurate quantification in MS1 spectra (CV < 15%) over a broad dynamic range (up to 1:40). In contrast, isobaric TMT labeling with quantification of reporter ions in tandem mass spectra suffered from severe ratio compression already at low sample ratios. To demonstrate the practical utility of the developed approach, we characterized the global N-linked glycosylation profiles of the isogenic human colon carcinoma cell lines SW480 (primary tumor) and SW620 (metastatic tumor). The data revealed significant down-regulation of high-mannose glycans in the metastatic cell line.",

Additional advantages of high-pH RPLC with fraction concatenation include improved protein sequence coverage, simplified sample processing and reduced sample losses, making this an attractive alternative to strong cation-exchange chromatography in conjunction with second-dimension low-pH RPLC for 2D proteomics analyses.",

    "abstract": "Methods for isobaric tagging of peptides, iTRAQ or TMT, are commonly used platforms in mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics. These two methods are very often used to quantitate proteins in complex samples, e.g., serum/plasma or CSF supporting biomarker discovery studies. The success of these studies depends on multiple factors, including the accuracy of ratios of reporter ions reflecting quantitative changes of proteins. Because reporter ions are generated during peptide fragmentation, the differences of chemical structure of iTRAQ balance groups may have an effect on how efficiently these groups are fragmented and thus how differences in protein expression will be measured. Because 4-plex and 8-plex iTRAQ reagents do have different structures of balanced groups, it has been postulated that indeed differences in protein identification and quantitation exist between these two reagents. In this study we controlled the ratios of tagged samples and compared quantitation of proteins using 4-plex versus 8-plex reagents in the context of a highly complex sample of human plasma using ABSciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and ProteinPilot 4.0 software. We observed that 8-plex tagging provides more consistent ratios than 4-plex without compromising protein identification, thus allowing investigation of eight experimental conditions in one analytical experiment.",

    "abstract": "We report the effects of supercharging reagents dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (m-NBA) applied to untargeted peptide identification, with special emphasis on non-tryptic peptides. Peptides generated from a mixture of five standard proteins digested with trypsin, elastase, or pepsin were separated with nanoflow liquid chromatography using mobile phases modified with either 5% DMSO or 0.1%m-NBA. Eluting peptides were ionized by online electrospray and sequenced by both CID and ETD using data-dependent MS/MS. Statistically significant improvements in peptide identifications were observed with DMSO co-solvent. In order to understand this observation, we assessed the effects of supercharging reagents on the chromatographic separation and the electrospray quality. The increase in identifications was not due to supercharging, which was greater for the 0.1%m-NBA co-solvent and not observed for the 5.0% DMSO co-solvent. The improved MS/MS efficiency using the DMSO modified mobile phase appeared to result from charge state coalescence.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput quantitative or semiquantitative glycoanalytical procedures are urgently required for biomarker discovery and quality control of glycoprotein pharmaceuticals. We describe here a strategy for high-throughput sample preparation for the relative quantitation of N-glycan patterns of human plasma glycoproteins. To this end, efficient glycan release is combined with a robust labeling step. Sample purification is achieved using solid phase extraction with a hydrophilic interaction chromatography stationary phase, which allows the separation of the labeled glycans from excess label, proteins, and matrix constituents such as salts and lipids. We show that the obtained labeled glycan sample solution is directly compatible with a number of downstream analytical techniques such as hydrophilic interaction and reverse-phase chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. High throughput is achieved by conducting all sample preparation steps in the 96-well format. The robustness and repeatability of the sample preparation strategy is evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The complete and specific proteolytic cleavage of protein samples into peptides is crucial for the success of every shotgun LC-MS/MS experiment. In particular, popular peptide-based label-free and targeted mass spectrometry approaches rely on efficient generation of fully cleaved peptides to ensure accurate and sensitive protein quantification. In contrast to previous studies, we globally and quantitatively assessed the efficiency of different digestion strategies using a yeast cell lysate, label-free quantification, and statistical analysis. Digestion conditions include double tryptic, surfactant-assisted, and tandem-combinatorial Lys-C/trypsin digestion. In comparison to tryptic digests, Lys-C/trypsin digests were found most efficient to yield fully cleaved peptides while reducing the abundance of miscleaved peptides. Subsequent sequence context analysis revealed improved digestion performances of Lys-C/trypsin for miscleaved sequence stretches flanked by charged basic and particulary acidic residues. Furthermore, targeted MS analysis demonstrated a more comprehensive protein cleavage only after Lys-C/trypsin digestion, resulting in a more accurrate absolute protein quantification and extending the number of peptides suitable for SRM assay development. Therefore, we conclude that a serial Lys-C/trypsin digestion is highly attractive for most applications in quantitative MS-based proteomics building on in-solution digestion schemes.",

    "abstract": "Redox-proteomics involves the large scale analysis of oxidative protein post-translational modifications. In particular, cysteine residues have become the subject of intensifying research interest because of their redox-reactive thiol side chain. Certain reactive cysteine residues can function as redox-switches, which sense changes in the local redox-environment by flipping between the reduced and oxidized state. Depending on the reactive oxygen or nitrogen species, cysteine residues can receive one of several oxidative modifications, each with the potential to confer a functional effect. Modification of these redox-switches has been found to play an important role in oxidative-signaling in the cardiovascular system and elsewhere. Due to the labile and dynamic nature of these modifications, several targeted approaches have been developed to enrich, identify and characterize the status of these critical residues. Here, we review the various proteomic strategies and limitations for the large scale analysis of the different oxidative cysteine modifications.",

    "abstract": "The hydrophobic nature of most membrane proteins severely complicates their extraction, proteolysis and identification. Although detergents can be used to enhance the solubility of the membrane proteins, it is often difficult for a detergent not only to have a strong ability to extract membrane proteins, but also to be compatible with the subsequent proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis. In this study, we made evaluation on a novel application of sodium laurate (SL) to the shotgun analysis of membrane proteomes. SL was found not only to lyse the membranes and solubilize membrane proteins as efficiently as SDS, but also to be well compatible with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Furthermore, SL could be efficiently removed by phase transfer method from samples after acidification, thus ensuring not to interfere with the subsequent CapLC-MS/MS analysis of the proteolytic peptides of proteins. When SL was applied to assist the digestion and identification of a standard protein mixture containing bacteriorhodoposin and the proteins in rat liver plasma membrane-enriched fractions, it was found that, compared with other two representative enzyme- and MS-compatible detergents RapiGest SF (RGS) and sodium deoxycholate (SDC), SL exhibited obvious superiority in the identification of membrane proteins particularly those with high hydrophobicity and/or multiple transmembrane domains.",

    "abstract": "The majority of mass spectrometry-based protein quantification studies uses peptide-centric analytical methods and thus strongly relies on efficient and unbiased protein digestion protocols for sample preparation. We present a novel objective approach to assess protein digestion efficiency using a combination of qualitative and quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem MS methods and statistical data analysis. In contrast to previous studies we employed both standard qualitative as well as data-independent quantitative workflows to systematically assess trypsin digestion efficiency and bias using mitochondrial protein fractions. We evaluated nine trypsin-based digestion protocols, based on standard in-solution or on spin filter-aided digestion, including new optimized protocols. We investigated various reagents for protein solubilization and denaturation (dodecyl sulfate, deoxycholate, urea), several trypsin digestion conditions (buffer, RapiGest, deoxycholate, urea), and two methods for removal of detergents before analysis of peptides (acid precipitation or phase separation with ethyl acetate). Our data-independent quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem MS workflow quantified over 3700 distinct peptides with 96% completeness between all protocols and replicates, with an average 40% protein sequence coverage and an average of 11 peptides identified per protein. Systematic quantitative and statistical analysis of physicochemical parameters demonstrated that deoxycholate-assisted in-solution digestion combined with phase transfer allows for efficient, unbiased generation and recovery of peptides from all protein classes, including membrane proteins. This deoxycholate-assisted protocol was also optimal for spin filter-aided digestions as compared with existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a widely used approach for the identification of protein-protein interactions. However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (for example, proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol. Here we present the contaminant repository for affinity purification (the CRAPome) and describe its use for scoring protein-protein interactions. The repository (currently available for Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and computational tools are freely accessible at http://www.crapome.org/.",

Using DiART tagged custom mixtures of two phosphorylated peptides from alpha casein and their non-phosphorylated counterparts, we demonstrate the compatibility of DiART with TiO2 affinity purification of phosphorylated peptides. Comparison of theoretical vs. experimental reporter ion ratios reveals accurate quantification of phosphorylated peptides over a dynamic range of more than 15-fold. Using DiART labelling and TiO2 enrichment (DiART-TiO2) with large quantities of proteins (8 mg) from the cell lysate of model fungus Aspergillus nidulans, we quantified 744 unique phosphopeptides. Overlap of median values of TiO2 enriched phosphopeptides with theoretical values indicates accurate trends. Altogether these findings confirm the feasibility of performing quantitative phosphoproteomic experiments in a cost-effective manner using isobaric tagging reagents, DiART.",

    "abstract": "Urea solution is one of the most commonly employed protein denaturants for protease digestion in proteomic studies. However, it has long been recognized that urea solution can cause carbamylation at the N termini of proteins/peptides and at the side chain amino groups of lysine and arginine residues. Protein/peptide carbamylation blocks protease digestion and affects protein identification and quantification in mass spectrometry analysis by blocking peptide amino groups from isotopic/isobaric labeling and changing peptide charge states, retention times, and masses. In addition, protein carbamylation during sample preparation makes it difficult to study in vivo protein carbamylation. In this study, we compared the peptide carbamylation in urea solutions of different buffers and found that ammonium-containing buffers were the most effective buffers to inhibit protein carbamylation in urea solution. The possible mechanism of carbamylation inhibition by ammonium-containing buffers is discussed, and a revised procedure for the protease digestion of proteins in urea and ammonium-containing buffers was developed to facilitate its application in proteomic research.",

    "abstract": "The structural characterization of proteins and peptides isolated in minute quantities requires the most efficient use of available sample. A mass spectrometer data system was programmed to continuously evaluate incoming liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry data against a user-defined array of information. The resulting conclusions were used to automatically set and modify acquisition parameters in real time to collect collision-induced dissociation spectra for selected ions (tandem mass spectrometry). This approach has provided a mechanism to target specific subsets of masses in a complex mixture and/or to discriminate selectively against masses that are known or not of interest. Masses of contaminants or peptide masses derived from known proteins can be automatically recorded and removed from further consideration for collision-induced dissociation analysis. Once recorded, these \"libraries\" of masses can be used across multiple analyses. This technique directs the mass spectrometer data system to focus on the analysis of masses significant to the user, even if their signal intensities are well below the intensities of contaminating masses. When combined with a database search program to correlate tandem mass spectra to known protein sequences, the identity of the protein can be established unequivocally by using less than 100 fmol of sample.",

    "abstract": "A method to correlate the uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of peptides produced under low energy (10-50 eV) collision conditions with amino acid sequences in the Genpept database has been developed. In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of ±1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database.",

Here, we integrated in-depth transcriptome and proteome analyses of liver tissues from two rat strains to unravel the interactions within and between these layers. We obtained peptide evidence for 26,463 rat liver proteins. We validated 1,195 gene predictions, 83 splice events, 126 proteins with nonsynonymous variants, and 20 isoforms with nonsynonymous RNA editing. Quantitative RNA sequencing and proteomics data correlate highly between strains but poorly among each other, indicating extensive nongenetic regulation. Our multilevel analysis identified a genomic variant in the promoter of the most differentially expressed gene Cyp17a1, a previously reported top hit in genome-wide association studies for human hypertension, as a potential contributor to the hypertension phenotype in SHR rats. These results demonstrate the power of and need for integrative analysis for understanding genetic control of molecular dynamics and phenotypic diversity in a system-wide manner.",

    "abstract": "Bottom-up proteomics largely relies on tryptic peptides for protein identification and quantification. Tryptic digestion often provides limited coverage of protein sequence because of issues such as peptide length, ionization efficiency, and post-translational modification colocalization. Unfortunately, a region of interest in a protein, for example, because of proximity to an active site or the presence of important post-translational modifications, may not be covered by tryptic peptides. Detection limits, quantification accuracy, and isoform differentiation can also be improved with greater sequence coverage. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) would also greatly benefit from being able to identify additional targetable sequences. In an attempt to improve protein sequence coverage and to target regions of proteins that do not generate useful tryptic peptides, we deployed a multiprotease strategy on the HeLa proteome. First, we used seven commercially available enzymes in single, double, and triple enzyme combinations. A total of 48 digests were performed. 5223 proteins were detected by analyzing the unfractionated cell lysate digest directly; with 42% mean sequence coverage. Additional strong-anion exchange fractionation of the most complementary digests permitted identification of over 3000 more proteins, with improved mean sequence coverage. We then constructed a web application (https://proteomics.swmed.edu/confetti) that allows the community to examine a target protein or protein isoform in order to discover the enzyme or combination of enzymes that would yield peptides spanning a certain region of interest in the sequence. Finally, we examined the use of nontryptic digests for SRM. From our strong-anion exchange fractionation data, we were able to identify three or more proteotypic SRM candidates within a single digest for 6056 genes. Surprisingly, in 25% of these cases the digest producing the most observable proteotypic peptides was neither trypsin nor Lys-C. SRM analysis of Asp-N versus tryptic peptides for eight proteins determined that Asp-N yielded higher signal in five of eight cases.",

    "abstract": "Protein G (also designated Fc receptor type III) is the IgG-binding protein of group C and G streptococci. Protein G has also been shown to bind human serum albumin but at a site that is structurally separated from the IgG-binding region. From the known gene sequence of protein G, two synthetic oligonucleotides were constructed for use as probes in DNA-hybridization experiments to study the structure and distribution of the albumin- and IgG-binding regions in bacterial strains belonging to different species. Thus, one of the probes corresponded to repeats within the IgG-binding region (I) and the other corresponded to repeats in the albumin-binding encoding region (II). Probe I showed strong hybridization to DNA isolated from 31 human group C and G strains, whereas hybridization to probe II was variable. With the three restriction endonucleases used, three restriction patterns were found in Southern blot experiments. No fundamental difference could be detected in hybridization experiments, either between strains of group C and G streptococci, or between isolates of different clinical origin. No hybridization to DNA from other bacterial species was found.",

The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight and fosters the development of proteomic technology.",

    "abstract": "S-Nitrosylation is a redox-based protein post-translational modification in response to nitric oxide signaling and is involved in a wide range of biological processes. Detection and quantification of protein S-nitrosylation have been challenging tasks due to instability and low abundance of the modification. Many studies have used mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods with different thiol-reactive reagents to label and identify proteins with S-nitrosylated cysteine (SNO-Cys). In this study, we developed a novel iodoTMT switch assay (ISA) using an isobaric set of thiol-reactive iodoTMTsixplex reagents to specifically detect and quantify protein S-nitrosylation. Irreversible labeling of SNO-Cys with the iodoTMTsixplex reagents enables immune-affinity detection of S-nitrosylated proteins, enrichment of iodoTMT-labeled peptides by anti-TMT resin, and importantly, unambiguous modification site-mapping and multiplex quantification by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Additionally, we significantly improved anti-TMT peptide enrichment efficiency by competitive elution. Using ISA, we identified a set of SNO-Cys sites responding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in murine BV-2 microglial cells and revealed effects of S-allyl cysteine from garlic on LPS-induced protein S-nitrosylation in antioxidative signaling and mitochondrial metabolic pathways. ISA proved to be an effective proteomic approach for quantitative analysis of S-nitrosylation in complex samples and will facilitate the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of nitrosative stress in disease.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bond identification is important for a detailed understanding of protein structures, which directly affect their biological functions. Here we describe an integrated workflow for the fast and accurate identification of authentic protein disulfide bridges. This novel workflow incorporates acidic proteolytic digestion using pepsin to eliminate undesirable disulfide reshuffling during sample preparation and a novel search engine, SlinkS, to directly identify disulfide-bridged peptides isolated via electron transfer higher energy dissociation (EThcD). In EThcD fragmentation of disulfide-bridged peptides, electron transfer dissociation preferentially leads to the cleavage of the S-S bonds, generating two intense disulfide-cleaved peptides as primary fragment ions. Subsequently, higher energy collision dissociation primarily targets unreacted and charge-reduced precursor ions, inducing peptide backbone fragmentation. SlinkS is able to provide the accurate monoisotopic precursor masses of the two disulfide-cleaved peptides and the sequence of each linked peptide by matching the remaining EThcD product ions against a linear peptide database. The workflow was validated using a protein mixture containing six proteins rich in natural disulfide bridges. Using this pepsin-based workflow, we were able to efficiently and confidently identify a total of 31 unique Cys-Cys bonds (out of 43 disulfide bridges present), with no disulfide reshuffling products detected. Pepsin digestion not only outperformed trypsin digestion in terms of the number of detected authentic Cys-Cys bonds, but, more important, prevented the formation of artificially reshuffled disulfide bridges due to protein digestion under neutral pH. Our new workflow therefore provides a precise and generic approach for disulfide bridge mapping, which can be used to study protein folding, structure, and stability.",

    "abstract": "We have developed an innovative method to remove albumin from plasma/serum samples for the LC-MS/MS quantitation of therapeutic proteins. Different combinations of organic solvents and acids were screened for their ability to remove albumin from plasma and serum samples. Removal efficiency was monitored by two signature peptides (QTALVELVK and LVNEVTEFAK) from albumin. Isopropanol with 1.0% trichloroacetic acid was found to be the most effective combination to remove albumin while retaining the protein of interest. Our approach was compared with a commercial albumin depletion kit on both efficiency of albumin removal and recovery of target proteins. We have demonstrated that our approach can remove 95% of the total albumin in human plasma samples while retaining close to 100% for two of three therapeutic proteins tested, with the third one at 60-80%. The commercial kit removed 98% of albumin but suffered at least 50% recovery loss for all therapeutic proteins when compared to our approach. Using BMS-C as a probe compound, the incorporation of the albumin removal approach has improved both assay sensitivity and ruggedness, compared to the whole plasma protein digestion approach alone. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated based on this new approach for the analysis of BMS-C in monkey serum. This assay was successfully applied to a toxicological study. When the albumin removal method was used in another clinical LC-MS/MS method, the sensitivity improved 10-fold to 50 ng/mL LLOQ comparing to a typical pellet digestion method.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry plays a key role in relative quantitative comparisons of proteins in order to understand their functional role in biological systems upon perturbation. In this review, we review studies that examine different aspects of isobaric labeling-based relative quantification for shotgun proteomic analysis. In particular, we focus on different types of isobaric reagents and their reaction chemistry (e.g., amine-, carbonyl-, and sulfhydryl-reactive). Various factors, such as ratio compression, reporter ion dynamic range, and others, cause an underestimation of changes in relative abundance of proteins across samples, undermining the ability of the isobaric labeling approach to be truly quantitative. These factors that affect quantification and the suggested combinations of experimental design and optimal data acquisition methods to increase the precision and accuracy of the measurements will be discussed. Finally, the extended application of isobaric labeling-based approach in hyperplexing strategy, targeted quantification, and phosphopeptide analysis are also examined.",

    "abstract": "Proteins regulate many cellular functions and analyzing the presence and abundance of proteins in biological samples are central focuses in proteomics. The discovery and validation of biomarkers, pathways, and drug targets for various diseases can be accomplished using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. However, with mass-limited samples like tumor biopsies, it can be challenging to obtain sufficient amounts of proteins to generate high-quality mass spectrometric data. Techniques developed for macroscale quantities recover sufficient amounts of protein from milligram quantities of starting material, but sample losses become crippling with these techniques when only microgram amounts of material are available. To combat this challenge, proteomicists have developed micro-scale techniques that are compatible with decreased sample size (100 μg or lower) and still enable excellent proteome coverage. Extraction, contaminant removal, protein quantitation, and sample handling techniques for the microgram protein range are reviewed here, with an emphasis on liquid chromatography and bottom-up mass spectrometry-compatible techniques. Also, a range of biological specimens, including mammalian tissues and model cell culture systems, are discussed.",

The conversion of proteins into peptides in these so-called bottom-up approaches is nearly uniquely done by using trypsin as a proteolytic reagent. Here, we argue that our view of the proteome still remains incomplete and this is partially due to the nearly exclusive use of trypsin. Newly emerging alternative proteases and/or multi-protease protein digestion aim to increase proteome sequence coverage and improve the identification of post-translational modifications, through the analysis of complementary and often longer peptides, introducing an approach termed middle-down proteomics. Of pivotal importance for this purpose is the identification of proteases beneficial for use in proteomics. Here, we describe some of the shortcomings of the nearly exclusive use of trypsin in proteomics and review the properties of other proteomics-appropriate proteases. We describe favorable protease traits with an emphasis on middle-down proteomics and suggest potential sources for the discovery of new proteases. We also highlight a few examples wherein the use of other proteases than trypsin enabled the generation of more comprehensive data sets leading to previously unexplored knowledge of the proteome.",

Here we evaluate measurements of tryptophan fluorescence (WF) for total protein determination in whole tissue lysates and for peptide quantification in protein digests. We demonstrate that the fluorescence spectrometry of tryptophan offers a simple, sensitive, and direct method for protein and peptide assays. The WF assay is fully compatible with SDS and other solutes that are commonly used for lysis of tissue and cells. We found that the content of tryptophan varies only a little between mouse tissues (1.16 ± 0.08% of total amino acids) and is similar in human cells (1.19 ± 0.06%). Therefore, free tryptophan can be used as a universal standard. We show that the assay can be carried out on a standard fluorescence spectrometer with cuvettes as well as in a 96-well format using a plate reader. The method is particularly suitable for determination of peptide content in diluted samples. Notably, the whole sample can be recovered after the measurement.",

    "abstract": "Colorimetric protein assays, such as the Coomassie blue G-250 dye-binding (Bradford) and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assays, are commonly used to quantify protein concentration. The accuracy of these assays depends on the amino acid composition. Because of the extensive use of reductive methylation in the study of proteins and the importance of biological methylation, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of lysyl methylation on the Bradford and BCA assays. Unmodified and reductively methylated proteins were analyzed using the absorbance at 280 nm to standardize the concentrations. Using model compounds, we demonstrate that the dimethylation of lysyl ε-amines does not affect the proteins' molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm. For the Bradford assay, the responses (absorbance per unit concentration) of the unmodified and reductively methylated proteins were similar, with a slight decrease in the response upon methylation. For the BCA assay, the responses of the reductively methylated proteins were consistently higher, overestimating the concentrations of the methylated proteins. The enhanced color formation in the BCA assay may be due to the lower acid dissociation constants of the lysyl ε-dimethylamines compared with the unmodified ε-amine, favoring Cu(II) binding in biuret-like complexes. The implications for the analysis of biologically methylated samples are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Isobaric tagging reagents have become an invaluable tool for multiplexed quantitative proteomic analysis. These reagents can label multiple, distinct peptide samples from virtually any source material (e.g., tissue, cell line, purified proteins), allowing users the opportunity to assess changes in peptide abundances across many different time points or experimental conditions. Here, we describe the application of isobaric peptide labeling, specifically 8plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (8plex iTRAQ), for quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of cultured cells or tissue suspensions. For this particular protocol, labeled samples are pooled, fractionated by strong cation exchange chromatography, enriched for phosphopeptides, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for both peptide identification and quantitation.",

Surprisingly, we identified cleavage sites for this enzyme at the N-terminal side of several glutamyl residues in addition to the expected cleavage sites at aspartyl residues. The ability of this enzyme to cleave polypeptides at both glutamyl and aspartyl residues was confirmed by mapping additional sites on erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I.

    "abstract": "Common yet often overlooked, deamidation of peptidyl asparagine (Asn or N) generates aspartic acid (Asp or D) or isoaspartic acid (isoAsp or isoD). Being a spontaneous, non-enzymatic protein post-translational modification, deamidation artifact can be easily introduced during sample preparation, especially proteolysis where higher-order structures are removed. This artifact not only complicates the analysis of bona fide deamidation but also affects a wide range of chemical and enzymatic processes; for instance, the newly generated Asp and isoAsp residues may block or introduce new proteolytic sites, and also convert one Asn peptide into multiple species that affect quantification. While the neutral to mildly basic conditions for common proteolysis favor deamidation, mildly acidic conditions markedly slow down the process. Unlike other commonly used endoproteases, Glu-C remains active under mildly acid conditions. As such, as demonstrated herein, deamidation artifact during proteolysis was effectively eliminated by simply performing Glu-C digestion at pH 4.5 in ammonium acetate, a volatile buffer that is compatible with mass spectrometry. Moreover, nearly identical sequence specificity was observed at both pH's (8.0 for ammonium bicarbonate), rendering Glu-C as effective at pH 4.5. In summary, this method is generally applicable for protein analysis as it requires minimal sample preparation and uses the readily available Glu-C protease.",

    "abstract": "Protein digestion using a dedicated protease represents a key element in a typical mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics experiment. Up to now, digestion has been predominantly performed with trypsin, mainly because of its high specificity, widespread availability and ease of use. Lately, it has become apparent that the sole use of trypsin in bottom-up proteomics may impose certain limits in our ability to grasp the full proteome, missing out particular sites of post-translational modifications, protein segments or even subsets of proteins. To overcome this problem, the proteomics community has begun to explore alternative proteases to complement trypsin. However, protocols, as well as expected results generated from these alternative proteases, have not been systematically documented. Therefore, here we provide an optimized protocol for six alternative proteases that have already shown promise in their applicability in proteomics, namely chymotrypsin, LysC, LysN, AspN, GluC and ArgC. This protocol is formulated to promote ease of use and robustness, which enable parallel digestion with each of the six tested proteases. We present data on protease availability and usage including recommendations for reagent preparation. We additionally describe the appropriate MS data analysis methods and the anticipated results in the case of the analysis of a single protein (BSA) and a more complex cellular lysate (Escherichia coli). The digestion protocol presented here is convenient and robust and can be completed in ∼2 d.",

    "abstract": "The enormous depth complexity of the human plasma proteome poses a significant challenge for current mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies in terms of detecting low-level proteins in plasma, which is essential for successful biomarker discovery efforts. Typically, a single-step analytical approach cannot reduce this intrinsic complexity. Current simplex immunodepletion techniques offer limited capacity for detecting low-abundance proteins, and integrated strategies are thus desirable. In this respect, we developed an improved strategy for analyzing the human plasma proteome by integrating polyethylene glycol (PEG) fractionation with immunoaffinity depletion. PEG fractionation of plasma proteins is simple, rapid, efficient, and compatible with a downstream immunodepletion step. Compared with immunodepletion alone, our integrated strategy substantially improved the proteome coverage afforded by PEG fractionation. Coupling this new protocol with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, 135 proteins with reported normal concentrations below 100 ng/mL were confidently identified as common low-abundance proteins. A side-by-side comparison indicated that our integrated strategy was increased by average 43.0% in the identification rate of low-abundance proteins, relying on an average 65.8% increase of the corresponding unique peptides. Further investigation demonstrated that this combined strategy could effectively alleviate the signal-suppressive effects of the major high-abundance proteins by affinity depletion, especially with moderate-abundance proteins after incorporating PEG fractionation, thereby greatly enhancing the detection of low-abundance proteins. In sum, the newly developed strategy of incorporating PEG fractionation to immunodepletion methods can potentially aid in the discovery of plasma biomarkers of therapeutic and clinical interest.",

The search database is one of the major influencing factors in discovering proteins present in the sample and thus in deriving biological conclusions.

We also elaborate upon factors like composition and size of the search database that can influence the protein identification process. In conclusion, we suggest that choice of the database depends on the type of inferences to be derived from proteomics data.

    "abstract": "Structural information regarding metallothioneins (MTs) has been hard to come by due to its highly dynamic nature in the absence of metal-thiolate cluster formation and crystallization difficulties. Thus, typical spectroscopic methods for structural determination are limited in their usefulness when applied to MTs. Mass spectrometric methods have revolutionized our understanding of protein dynamics, structure, and folding. Recently, advances have been made in residue modification mass spectrometry in order to probe the hard-to-characterize structure of apo- and partially metalated MTs. By using different cysteine specific alkylation reagents, time dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and step-wise \"snapshot\" ESI-MS, we are beginning to understand the dynamics of the conformers of apo-MT and related species. In this review we highlight recent papers that use these and similar techniques for structure elucidation and attempt to explain in a concise manner the data interpretations of these complex methods. We expect increasing resolution in our picture of the structural conformations of metal-free MTs as these techniques are more widely adopted and combined with other promising tools for structural elucidation.",

    "abstract": "Reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues is part of virtually any proteomics workflow. Despite its frequent use, up to date no systematic investigation of the impact of different conditions on the outcome of proteomics studies has been performed. In this study, we compared common reduction reagents (dithiothreitol, tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, and β-mercaptoethanol) and alkylation reagents (iodoacetamide, iodoacetic acid, acrylamide, and chloroacetamide). Using in-gel digests as well as SAX fractionated in-solution digests of cytosolic fractions of HeLa cells, we evaluated 13 different reduction and alkylation conditions resulting in considerably varying identification rates. We observed strong differences in offsite alkylation reactions at 7 amino acids as well as at the peptide N terminus, identifying single and double adducts of all reagents. Using dimethyl labeling, mass tolerant searches, and synthetic peptide experiments, we identified alkylation of methionine residues by iodine-containing alkylation reagents as one of the major factors for the differences. We observed differences of more than 9-fold in numbers of identified methionine-containing peptide spectral matches for in-gel digested samples between iodine- and noniodine-containing alkylation reagents. This was because of formation of carbamidomethylated and carboxymethylated methionine side chains and a resulting prominent neutral loss during ESI ionization or in MS/MS fragmentation, strongly decreasing identification rates of methionine-containing peptides. We achieved best results with acrylamide as alkylation reagent, whereas the highest numbers of peptide spectral matches were obtained when reducing with dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol for the in-solution and the in-gel digested samples, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and reproducible sample preparation is a prerequisite for any robust and sensitive quantitative bottom-up proteomics workflow. Here, we performed an independent comparison between single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), and a commercial kit based on the in-StageTip (iST) method. We assessed their performance for the processing of proteomic samples in the low μg range using varying amounts of HeLa cell lysate (1-20 μg of total protein). All three workflows showed similar performances for 20 μg of starting material. When handling sample sizes below 10 μg, the number of identified proteins and peptides as well as the quantitative reproducibility and precision drastically dropped in case of FASP. In contrast, SP3 and iST provided high proteome coverage even in the low μg range. Even when digesting 1 μg of starting material, both methods still enabled the identification of over 3000 proteins and between 25 000 and 30 000 peptides. On average, the quantitative reproducibility between experimental replicates was slightly higher in case of SP3 (R",

    "abstract": "Protein structural changes induced by external perturbations or internal cues can profoundly influence protein activity and thus modulate cellular physiology. A number of biophysical approaches are available to probe protein structural changes, but these are not applicable to a whole proteome in a biological extract. Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) is a recently developed proteomics approach that enables the identification of protein structural changes directly in their complex biological context on a proteome-wide scale. After perturbations of interest, proteome extracts are subjected to a double-protease digestion step with a nonspecific protease applied under native conditions, followed by complete digestion with the sequence-specific protease trypsin under denaturing conditions. This sequential treatment generates structure-specific peptides amenable to bottom-up MS analysis. Next, a proteomics workflow involving shotgun or targeted MS and label-free quantification is applied to measure structure-dependent proteolytic patterns directly in the proteome extract. Possible applications of LiP-MS include discovery of perturbation-induced protein structural alterations, identification of drug targets, detection of disease-associated protein structural states, and analysis of protein aggregates directly in biological samples. The approach also enables identification of the specific protein regions involved in the structural transition or affected by the binding event. Sample preparation takes approximately 2 d, followed by one to several days of MS and data analysis time, depending on the number of samples analyzed. Scientists with basic biochemistry training can implement the sample preparation steps. MS measurement and data analysis require a background in proteomics.",

    "abstract": "Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification regulates numerous cellular processes. Unlike ubiquitin, detection of endogenous SUMOylated proteins is limited by the lack of naturally occurring protease sites in the C-terminal tail of SUMO proteins. Proteome-wide detection of SUMOylation sites on target proteins typically requires ectopic expression of mutant SUMOs with introduced tryptic sites. Here, we report a method for proteome-wide, site-level detection of endogenous SUMOylation that uses α-lytic protease, WaLP. WaLP digestion of SUMOylated proteins generates peptides containing SUMO-remnant diglycyl-lysine (KGG) at the site of SUMO modification. Using previously developed immuno-affinity isolation of KGG-containing peptides followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 1209 unique endogenous SUMO modification sites. We also demonstrate the impact of proteasome inhibition on ubiquitin and SUMO-modified proteomes using parallel quantitation of ubiquitylated and SUMOylated peptides. This methodological advancement enables determination of endogenous SUMOylated proteins under completely native conditions.",

    "abstract": "A genetic approach is described to clarify the IgG-binding properties of the N-terminal portion of staphylococcal protein A (region E). Several gene fragments, encoding region E or B or protein A, have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene products were purified by IgG-affinity chromatography and subjected to structural and functional analyses. Both fragments can be efficiently purified using this method, suggesting that region B as well as region E has Fc-binding activity. In addition, gene fusions were assembled giving fragments EB and EE, which both showed a divalent Fc-binding. These results demonstrate that protein A consists of five IgG-binding domains. The implications of these findings for the structure of protein-A--immunoglobulin-G complexes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is one of the most common polymer contaminations in mass spectrometry (MS) samples. At present, the detection of PEG and other polymers relies largely on manual inspection of raw data, which is laborious and frequently difficult due to sample complexity and retention characteristics of polymer species in reversed-phase chromatography. We developed a new strategy for the automated identification of PEG molecules from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data using protein identification algorithms in combination with a database containing \"PEG-proteins\". Through definition of variable modifications, we extend the approach for the identification of commonly used PEG-based detergents. We exemplify the identification of different types of polymers by static nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS) analysis of pure detergent solutions and data analysis using Mascot. Analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) runs of a PEG-contaminated sample by Mascot identified 806 PEG spectra originating from four PEG species using a defined set of modifications covering PEG and common PEG-based detergents. Further characterization of the sample for unidentified PEG species using error-tolerant and mass-tolerant searches resulted in identification of 3409 and 3187 PEG-related MS/MS spectra, respectively. We further demonstrate the applicability of the strategy for Protein Pilot and MaxQuant.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we have reported a novel fabrication technique for human serum albumin (HSA) imprinted composite bacterial cellulose nanofibers (MIP-cBCNFs) used for the depletion of HSA selectively from artificial blood plasma for proteomic applications. Molecular imprinting was achieved by using metal ion coordination interactions of N‑methacryloyl‑(l)‑histidinemethylester (MAH) monomer and Cu(II) ions. MAH-Cu(II)-HSA complex was polymerized with bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNFs) under constant stirring at room temperature. The characterization of the MIP-cBCNFs was carried out by FTIR-ATR, SEM, contact angle measurements and surface area measurements. The adsorption experiments of HSA onto the MIP-BCNFs and NIP-BCNFs from aqueous HSA solutions were investigated in a batch system. The selectivity of the MIP-cBCNFs was investigated by using non-template human transferrin (HTR), and myoglobin (Myo). The relative selectivity coefficients of the MIP-cBCNFs were calculated as 4.73 and 3.02 for HSA/HTR and HSA/Myo molecules, respectively. In addition, the depletion of HSA from artificial human plasma was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and 2-D gel electrophoresis. As a result, it has been shown that metal ion coordination interactions contribute to specific binding of template when preparing MIP-cBCNFs for the depletion of HSA with a high adsorption capacity, significant selectivity and reusability.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of individual proteins is an essential task in understanding biological processes. For example, determination of concentrations of proteins transporting and metabolizing xenobiotics is a prerequisite for drug disposition predictions in humans based on in vitro data. So far, this task has frequently been accomplished by targeted proteomics. This type of analyses requires preparation of stable isotope labeled standards for each protein of interest. The selection of appropriate standard peptides is usually tedious and the number of proteins that can be studied in a single experiment by these approaches is limited. In addition, incomplete digestion of proteins often affects the accuracy of the quantification. To circumvent these constrains in proteomic protein quantification, label- and standard-free approaches, such as \"total protein approach\" (TPA) have been proposed. Here we directly compare an approach using stable isotope labeled (SIL) standards and TPA for quantification of transporters and enzymes in human liver samples within the same LC-MS/MS runs. We show that TPA is a convenient alternative to SIL-based methods. Optimization of the sample preparation beyond commonly used single tryptic digestion, by adding consecutive cleavage steps, improves accuracy and reproducibility of the TPA method to a level, which is achievable by analysis using stable isotope-labeled standard spiking.",

The COOH-terminal 49 residues of the pro-peptide are significantly homologous to the propeptides of Streptomyces griseus proteases A and B.

However, the procedure can yield different results for a fixed data set analyzed with different decoy databases, and this decoy-induced variability is particularly problematic for smaller FDR thresholds, data sets, or databases. The average TDC (aTDC) protocol combats this problem by exploiting multiple independently shuffled decoy databases to provide an FDR estimate with reduced variability. We provide a tutorial introduction to aTDC, describe an improved variant of the protocol that offers increased statistical power, and discuss how to deploy aTDC in practice using the Crux software toolkit.",

    "abstract": "In the postgenome era, biologists have sought to measure the complete complement of proteins, termed proteomics. Currently, the most effective method to measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the proteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein inference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun proteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are identified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage would allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all posttranslational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy of biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit, but ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that are too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true origin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by several analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide lengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit observable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also explored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be achieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases and chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 92.9% proteome coverage.",

    "abstract": "Isobaric stable isotope labeling using, for example, tandem mass tags (TMTs) is increasingly being applied for large-scale proteomic studies. Experiments focusing on proteoform analysis in drug time course or perturbation studies or in large patient cohorts greatly benefit from the reproducible quantification of single peptides across samples. However, such studies often require labeling of hundreds of micrograms of peptides such that the cost for labeling reagents represents a major contribution to the overall cost of an experiment. Here, we describe and evaluate a robust and cost-effective protocol for TMT labeling that reduces the quantity of required labeling reagent by a factor of eight and achieves complete labeling. Under- and overlabeling of peptides derived from complex digests of tissues and cell lines were systematically evaluated using peptide quantities of between 12.5 and 800 μg and TMT-to-peptide ratios (wt/wt) ranging from 8:1 to 1:2 at different TMT and peptide concentrations. When reaction volumes were reduced to maintain TMT and peptide concentrations of at least 10 mm and 2 g/l, respectively, TMT-to-peptide ratios as low as 1:1 (wt/wt) resulted in labeling efficiencies of > 99% and excellent intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility. The utility of the optimized protocol was further demonstrated in a deep-scale proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of patient-derived xenograft tumor tissue benchmarked against the labeling procedure recommended by the TMT vendor. Finally, we discuss the impact of labeling reaction parameters for N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-based chemistry and provide guidance on adopting efficient labeling protocols for different peptide quantities.",

Top-down mass spectrometry enables the analysis of intact proteins and proteoforms. Here members of the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics provide a decision tree that guides researchers to robust protocols for mass analysis of intact proteins (antibodies, membrane proteins and others) from mixtures of varying complexity. We also present cross-platform analytical benchmarks using a protein standard sample, to allow users to gauge their proficiency.",

The aim behind using cRFP is to prevent the contaminant FBS proteins from being misidentified as other proteins in the reference database, just as we would use cRAP (common Repository of Adventitious Proteins) to prevent contaminant proteins present either by accident or through unavoidable contacts from being misidentified as other proteins. We expect it to be widely used in experiments where the proteins are obtained from serum-free media after thorough washing of the cells, or from a complex media such as SILAC, or from extracellular vesicles directly.",

    "abstract": "Plasma and serum are widely used for proteomics-based biomarker discovery. However, analysis of these biofluids is highly challenging due to the complexity and wide dynamic range of their proteomes. Notably, highly abundant proteins tend to obscure the detection of potential biomarkers that are usually of lower concentrations. Among the strategies to resolve this problem are: depletion of high-abundance proteins, enrichment of low abundant proteins of interest and prefractionation. In this review, we focus on current and emerging depletion techniques used to enhance the detection and identification of the less abundant proteins in plasma and serum. We discuss the applications and contributions of these methods to proteomics analysis of plasma and serum alongside their limitations and future perspectives.",

    "abstract": "For the last century we have relied on model organisms to help understand fundamental biological processes. Now, with advancements in genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation, non-model organisms may be studied with the same advanced bioanalytical toolkit as model organisms. Proteomics is one such technique, which classically relies on predicted protein sequences to catalog and measure complex proteomes across tissues and biofluids. Applying proteomics to non-model organisms can advance and accelerate biomimicry studies, biomedical advancements, veterinary medicine, agricultural research, behavioral ecology, and food safety. In this postmodel organism era, we can study almost any species, meaning that many non-model organisms are, in fact, important emerging model organisms. Herein we specifically focus on eukaryotic organisms and discuss the steps to generate sequence databases, analyze proteomic data with or without a database, and interpret results as well as future research opportunities. Proteomics is more accessible than ever before and will continue to rapidly advance in the coming years, enabling critical research and discoveries in non-model organisms that were hitherto impossible.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an architectural meshwork that surrounds and supports cells. The dysregulation of heavily post-translationally modified ECM proteins directly contributes to various diseases. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is an ideal tool to identify ECM proteins and characterize their post-translational modifications, but ECM proteomics remains challenging owing to the extremely low solubility of the ECM. Herein, enabled by effective solubilization of ECM proteins using our recently developed photocleavable surfactant, Azo, we have developed a streamlined ECM proteomic strategy that allows fast tissue decellularization, efficient extraction and enrichment of ECM proteins, and rapid digestion prior to reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-MS analysis. A total of 173 and 225 unique ECM proteins from mouse mammary tumors have been identified using 1D and 2D RPLC-MS/MS, respectively. Moreover, 87 (from 1DLC-MS/MS) and 229 (from 2DLC-MS/MS) post-translational modifications of ECM proteins, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and hydroxylation, were identified and localized. This Azo-enabled ECM proteomics strategy will streamline the analysis of ECM proteins and promote the study of ECM biology.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is routinely used to identify, characterize, and quantify biological molecules. For protein analysis, MS-based workflows can be broadly categorized as top-down or bottom-up, depending on whether the proteins are analyzed as intact molecules or first digested into peptides. This article outlines steps for preparing peptide samples for MS as part of a bottom-up proteomics workflow, providing versatile methods suitable for discovery and targeted analyses in qualitative and quantitative workflows. Resulting samples contain peptides of suitable size for analysis by MS instrumentation generally available to modern research laboratories, including MS coupled to either liquid chromatography (LC) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) interfaces. This article incorporates recent developments in methodologies and consumables to facilitate sample preparation. The protocols are well-suited to users without prior experience in proteomics and include methods for universally applicable suspension trap processing and for alternate in-solution processing to accommodate a range of sample types.

    "abstract": "Lyophilization is a cost-effective method for biological specimen preservation but detailed tissue-specific reference protocols are still lacking. Moreover, data are limited on the long-term stability of proteins and nucleic acids in lyophilized samples.Here, we offer lyophilization protocols for various rat and mouse tissues (kidney, heart, liver, lung, aorta, and skin) coupled with technical hints for optimal sample preparation. We demonstrate that lyophilized samples stored at 4 °C for 20 months can yield protein and RNA of similar quantity and quality to -80 °C storage, while phosphorylated proteins are preserved as well. Freeze-dried and subsequently pulverized samples can provide more consistent, more reliable data especially when investigating focal injuries, such as fibrosis. We developed a protocol for the concentration of biological solutions and achieved 20-times concentration in human peritoneal dialysis effluent solution which enables the previously unattainable detection of proteins in these samples. We established a method for water removal as well as accurate water content measurement of fecal samples, which can be valuable for gut metabolome analysis.Taken together, lyophilization is a valuable tool for the preservation of biological samples with many advantages. We aim to draw attention to the wide range of possibilities offered by freeze drying in pre-clinical or basic research.",

    "abstract": "The standard proteomics database search strategy involves searching spectra against a peptide database and estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of the resulting set of peptide-spectrum matches. One assumption of this protocol is that all the peptides in the database are relevant to the hypothesis being investigated. However, in settings where researchers are interested in a subset of peptides, alternative search and FDR control strategies are needed. Recently, two methods were proposed to address this problem: subset-search and all-sub. We show that both methods fail to control the FDR. For subset-search, this failure is due to the presence of \"neighbor\" peptides, which are defined as irrelevant peptides with a similar precursor mass and fragmentation spectrum as a relevant peptide. Not considering neighbors compromises the FDR estimate because a spectrum generated by an irrelevant peptide can incorrectly match well to a relevant peptide. Therefore, we have developed a new method, \"subset-neighbor search\" (SNS), that accounts for neighbor peptides. We show evidence that SNS controls the FDR when neighbors are present and that SNS outperforms group-FDR, the only other method that appears to control the FDR relative to a subset of relevant peptides.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the UV-vis spectra-activated droplet sorter (UVADS) for high-throughput label-free chemical identification and enzyme screening. In contrast to previous absorbance-based droplet sorters that relied on single-wavelength absorbance in the visible range, our platform collects full UV-vis spectra from 200 to 1050 nm at up to 2100 spectra per second. Our custom-built open-source software application, \"SpectraSorter,\" enables real-time data processing, analysis, visualization, and selection of droplets for sorting with any set of UV-vis spectral features. An optimized UV-vis detection region extended the absorbance path length for droplets and allowed for the direct protein quantification down to 10 μM of bovine serum albumin at 280 nm. UV-vis spectral data can distinguish a variety of different chemicals or spurious events (such as air bubbles) that are inaccessible at a single wavelength. The platform is used to measure ergothionase enzyme activity from monoclonal microcolonies isolated in droplets. In a label-free manner, we directly measure the ergothioneine substrate to thiourocanic acid product conversion while tracking the microcolony formation. UVADS represents an important new tool for high-throughput label-free in-droplet chemical analysis.",

    "abstract": "[1] Abraham J. Gitlitz Memorial Lecture: Development of a BroadSpectrum Antiviral-based Intranasal Spray as a Pandemic Preparedness Strategy. Kenneth E. Palmer, Ph.D, Center for Predictive Medicine for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases and Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY In early 2020, the public health emergency prompted many researchers to contemplate how they might contribute to control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This presentation will detail the research steps taken to bring a novel broad spectrum antiviral protein into a first in humans clinical trial. We had been developing a broad spectrum antiviral protein, the lectin Q-Griffithsin (Q-GRFT), as a topical microbicide for HIV-1 prevention. We knew that Q-GRFT also inhibited replication of many members of the Coronavirus family of pathogens, so initiated a rapid preclinical and clinical development program of a Q-GRFT intranasal spray as a prophylaxis modality against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. We finalized a suitable formulation to deliver Q-GRFT to the nasopharynx, the initial site of replication of SARS-CoV-2. Non-clinical toxicology studies supported first-in-human clinical studies. Efficacy studies in mice and hamsters provided proof of concept that Q-GRFT can protect animals against challenge. We filed an investigational new drug (IND) application, and received study may proceed authorization from the FDA. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled single dose safety and pharmacokinetics clinical study in 18 volunteers, all of whom had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The product was safe, and enhanced the levels of SARS-CoV-2 as well as MERS-CoV inhibitory activity present in the nasal and naso-pharyngeal swabs. The safety and pharmacokinetics profile of our Q-GRFT intranasal spray supports a multi-dose Phase 1b clinical study, and further development as a general pandemic preparedness strategy. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: describe the preclinical and clinical strategies employed to support a first in humans clinical trial of a novel broad-spectrum antiviral protein containing nasal spray; discuss planning, design and execution of a first-in-humans Phase 1a clinical trial for evaluation of safety, and selection of a dosing strategy for a Phase 1b multiple dose safety and pharmacokinetics study. [2] Acetylation pharmacogenomics: paradigm for informed individual risk assessment following environmental carcinogen exposure. David W. Hein, Ph.D, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Human epidemiological studies associating chemical exposures to cancer risk often are inconsistently validated across studies. Examples include the effect of smoking on cancer etiology other than the lung, such as urinary bladder and breast. Research findings from the laboratory have improved the understanding of arylamine carcinogen metabolism leading to improved design and interpretation of human molecular epidemiology investigations. Laboratory studies that infer and test biological plausibility, including cancer risks modified by differential metabolism of arylamine carcinogens in rapid and slow arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) acetylators, have been critical for investigating the role of smoking in the etiology of human cancers. This chapter will illustrate these concepts with an example of a cancer in which the role of smoking has largely been validated (urinary bladder cancer) and examples where a consensus has yet to be achieved. Portions of this work were funded by the following NIH grants: R01-CA034627; T32-ES011564; P42-ES023716; P20-GM113226; R25-CA134283; and P30-ES030283. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Assess the role of genetic polymorphisms in individual risk assessments following exposures to environmental carcinogens. 2. Recognize the importance of laboratory-based data in the biological plausibility of individual risk assessments. 3. Recognize the genetic complexity inherent in human epidemiological studies. [3] Rolling with the punches: A biosafety program at a research university addresses COVID-19. Allen Helm, PhD, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL This presentation describes the biosafety program at a research university and medical center, demonstrating how the program was modified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biosafety professionals are tasked with facilitating biomedical research by enacting coordinated efforts to protect research staff and students, the larger research community, and the environment and ecosystem from biological hazards used in the laboratory. These hazards include recombinant organisms ranging from microorganisms to animals, microbial pathogens, human-derived material, and biological toxins. The University of Chicago (UChicago) is an academic research institution affiliated with an urban medical center. There are approximately 300 biomedical principal investigator-led laboratories conducting investigations in basic, translational, and clinical science. The biosafety program at UChicago is part of the Office of Research Safety and consists of a director and four biosafety officers who perform a variety of duties, including: 1) Assisting researchers in planning experiments that utilize biohazards; 2) Developing and delivering biosafety training courses; 3) Performing annual inspections of laboratories; 4) Working with the university's Institutional Biosafety Committee; 5) Ensuring compliance with local, state, and federal agencies. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the biosafety program in several ways, as follows: 1) Altering administrative operations; 2) Developing biosafety standards for investigators working with SARS-CoV-2; 3) Establishing a \"COVID Core\" to handle influx of said researchers; 4) Enhanced biosafety interactions with clinical laboratories due to a demand for vaccines and treatments. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Identify the role of biosafety professionals in basic, translational, and clinical research. 2. Recognize how a pandemic can alter the way biosafety services are delivered to research programs. 3. Recognize the need for flexibility in a successful biosafety program. [4] An interdisciplinary Post Operative Personalized Pain Management Clinical Trial. Loralie J. Langman1, Jeremy Gaskins2, Gwendolyn A. McMillin3, Paul J. Jannetto1, Brandi Hartley4, Arthur Malkani4, and Saeed A. Jortani5, department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, 2Departments of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, 3Department of Pathology, University of Utah, ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, UT, 4Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, and 5Departments of Pathology, and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY Various sources of variability in response and toxicity to hydrocodone were investigated. In a cohort of orthopedic surgery patients, we interrogated the associations between genetic, intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors, plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and metabolites, common side effects, and pain score. Data for each patient was collected by the review of the electronic medical record and a patient interview at the time of sample collection. Patients with trauma or undergoing scheduled elective surgery for total knee or total hip replacement at the University of Louisville, Baptist East, and Jewish Hospitals, Louisville, KY. Plasma opiate concentrations and a targeted genotyping panel were performed. We observed statistically significant correlations for daily (p<0.001) and total dose (p=0.002) of hydrocodone. Duration of in-hospital and duration of opioid therapy for patients were also significantly different based on their genotypes. The length of opioid administration was significantly shorter in CYP2D6 EM/UM compared to patients with CYP2D6 PM/IM genotypes (p=0.018). Subjects with the OPRM1 c.118G polymorphism were also on opioids for a longer period of time (p=0.022). Co-administration of medications with CYP2D6 inhibitor activity had a significant effect on the length of opioid therapy (P<0.001). Both the hospital stay period and days of opioid use post hospital discharge were greater in patients with the inhibitor-adjusted CYP2D6 phenotype (p<0.001). This trial showed that patients should be evaluated for the use of inhibitors of CYP2D6. Interaction with these therapeutics while administering hydrocodone therapy can alter the phenotype of the patient (phenocopy) and result in longer opioid therapy duration. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. to discuss various sources of variability to response and toxicity of analgesics. 2. to present the post-operative pain management trial in a cohort of women just undergone Cesarean Section. 3. to present the post-operative pain management trial in a cohort of lower extremity orthopedic patients. [6] Claude P. Brown Memorial Lecture: The Many Roads to Steatohepatitis and its Treatment. Craig J. McClain, MD, University of Louisville School of Medicine,Louisville, KY Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are common histologic findings that can be caused by multiple etiologies. The three most frequent causes for steatosis/ steatohepatitis are alcohol (alcohol-associated steatohepatitis, ASH), obesity/metabolic syndrome (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and environmental toxicants (toxicant-associated steatohepatitis, TASH). Hepatic steatosis is an early occurrence in all three forms of liver disease, and they often share common pathways to disease progression/severity. Disease progression is a result of both direct effects on the liver as well as indirect alterations in other organs/tissues such as intestine, adipose tissue, and the immune system. Although the three liver diseases (ASH, NASH, and TASH) sharemany common pathogenic mechanisms, they also exhibit distinct differences. Both shared and divergent mechanisms can be potential therapeutic targets. I will provide an overview of selected important mechanistic similarities and differences in ASH, NASH, and TASH, and discuss the importance of a multidisciplinary and personalized approach. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. understand the mechanisms including similarities and differences between ASH, NASH and TASH. 2. understand targets to treat ASH, NASH and TASH. 3. recognize tests to help distinguish between ASH, NASH and TASH. [7] Bioactive lipid metabolites: biomarkers and therapeutic targets in alcohol-associated liver disease. Dennis Warner, Josiah Hardesty, Jeff Warner, Craig McClain, Irina Kirpich, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a spectrum of liver disorders ranging from steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. The mechanisms and mediators of ALD progression are not well understood and effective therapeutic options are limited. Various bioactive oxidized lipid mediators (oxylipins) have recently emerged as important factors in ALD pathogenesis. The current study aimed to examine plasma linoleic acid (LA)-derived lipid metabolites in heavy drinking individuals and to evaluate associations between these molecules and markers of liver injury. Analysis of plasma LA-derived metabolites was performed by HPLC/MS on 66 heavy drinking individuals and 29 socially drinking but otherwise healthy volunteers. Based on plasma ALT levels, 15 patients had no liver injury (ALT ≤ 40 U/L), 33 patients had mild liver injury (ALT > 40 U/L), and 18 were diagnosed with moderate Alcohol-associated Hepatitis (mAH). Statistically significant differences (set at p<0.05) were determined by One-way ANOVA. Lipoxygenase-derived LA metabolites, 13-HODE and 13-oxoODE, were markedly elevated only in mAH patients. The CYP450-derived LA epoxides, 9,10-EpOME and 12.13-EpOME were decreased in all patients regardless of the presence or the absence of liver injury. LA-derived diols, 9,10-DiHOME and 12.13-DiHOME, were elevated only in the mAH group. The current study provides evidence that specific changes in LA-metabolites in heavy drinking individuals can distinguish individuals with mAH from those with mild ALD. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. identify effects of alcohol consumption on circulating oxylipins; 2. determine the role of oxylipins in ALD pathogenesis; 3. associate severity of ALD with the specific changes in oxylipins [8] Hepatic protein and phosphoprotein signatures of alcohol-associated hepatitis. Josiah Hardesty, Jeffrey Warner, Dennis Warner, Craig McClain, and Irina Kirpich, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY The objective of the current study was to identify hepatic proteome and phosphoproteome signatures of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). AH is a clinical manifestation of ALD characterized by compromised liver function contributing to a 6-month mortality rate as high as 50%. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses were conducted on explant liver tissue from AH patients (n=6) and non-AH controls (n=12). Data were statistically compared by an unpaired Student's t-test and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Alterations the expression of multiple proteins involved in various biological processes were observed in AH. Among significant findings in AH included elevated expression of pro-fibrotic transcription factors, reduced albumin (ALBU) phosphorylation, and diminished expression of functional mitochondria proteins. One transcription factor involved in fibrogenesis, yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP1) was elevated in AH (p=0.003), along with increased phosphorylation at pS105 (p=0.01). In addition, expression of hepatic ALBU was elevated in AH (p=0.04) concomitant with diminished ALBU phosphorylation (p=0.02), which may prevent ALBU release leading to hypoalbuminemia. Lastly, we found a loss in the expression of mitochondria proteins in AH, including enzymes essential for mitochondria function and biogenesis (e.g., hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase trifunctional multienzyme complex subunit alpha, [ECHA] p=0.04). This study identified hepatic protein and phosphoprotein signatures of AH which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. understand the hepatic proteomic changes that occur in AH, 2. recognize hepatic protein and phosphoprotein signatures of AH and 3. identify novel mechanisms and pathways implicated in AH. [9] Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition in alcohol-associated liver disease: liver-specific drug delivery. Jeffrey Warner, Josiah Hardesty, Ying Song, Philip Bauer, Chirag Soni, Claudio Maldonado, Craig McClain, Dennis Warner, Irina Kirpich, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a prevalent condition resulting from excessive alcohol consumption. Advanced stages of ALD, such as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), cause significant mortality and lack effective therapies. Previous data established that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, an enzyme which degrades beneficial lipid epoxides) is induced in clinical/ experimental ALD, and that sEH inhibition may be an effective treatment for this disease. This study aimed to improve this approach by using liverspecific drug delivery via fusogenic lipid vesicles (FLVs) to increase efficacy and avoid extra-hepatic side effects. We prepared fluorescent-labeled FLVs loaded with the sEH inhibitor t-TUCB (t-TUCB-FLVs) at various doses. t-TUCB-FLV preparations had an appropriate size and charge and were confirmed to target the liver by fluorescent microscopy. Flow cytometry demonstrated that hepatocytes and macrophages were most responsible for t-TUCB-FLV uptake. In a dose response experiment using a chronic-binge ethanol feeding model mimicking AH, mice receiving ethanol+3.0 mg/kg t-TUCB-FLVs had the greatest reduction in liver injury by plasma ALT. This treatment was more efficacious than systemically delivered (non-FLV-encapsulated) t-TUCB at the same dose. t-TUCB-FLVs also decreased liver cell death and ER stress but had no effect on steatosis or neutrophil infiltration. These data demonstrated that liver-specific delivery of t-TUCB was more efficacious than systemic delivery. This drug delivery platform may help increase the efficacy of sEH inhibition in ALD while reducing extra-hepatic side effects, improving translation to humans. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1.recognize the pathogenic role of sEH in ALD; 2. Describe basic concepts in liver-specific drug delivery by nanoparticle systems; and 3. Evaluate the beneficial effects of a liver-targeted sEH inhibitor in experimental ALD in mice. [10] COVID-19 and early post-primary TB: commonalities of pathobiology in pneumonitis and therapies. Robert L. Hunter and Robert E.Brown, UTHealth McGovern Medical School Houston, TX Concurrent infection with COVID-19 and M. tuberculosis has been reported to be more severe than either alone, resulting in increased mortality. Our objective was to define the shared pathobiology of COVID-19 and the developmental stage of TB in the lung and explore adjunctive therapies to treat such commonalities. We used similar morphoproteomic analyses to study lung tissues of patients with early postprimary tuberculosis or COVID-19 infection.These studies showed colocalization of the COVID-19 virus and M. tuberculosis antigens with cyclo-oxygenase-2 and fatty acid synthase in the reactive alveolar pneumocytes and with programmed death-ligand 1 expression on the alveolar interstitium and alveolar pneumocytes.This was associated with accumulation of pro-infectious M2 polarized macrophages in the alveolar spaces.The commonalities in these pathways suggest that they might be susceptible to adjunctive therapies with metformin and vitamin D3. This is supported by published studies that metformin and vitamin D3 could reduce the severity of both COVID-19 and early post-primary TB infections. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to identify and define the commonalities in the pathobiology of COVID-19 and early post-primary TB pneumonitis and describe the potential targets for therapy with metformin and vitamin D3. [11] Plasma ctDNA for Monitoring Response to Immune Check Point Inhibitors. Mark W. Linder PhD, DABCC, FAACC. Professor Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) measurements from a variety of malignancies are aggressively being investigated in the context of a \"liquid biopsy\" to provide for a minimally invasive means of monitoring tumor status and therapeutic response. This session will discuss what is known about the biologic and physiological characteristics of plasma ctDNA. We will then describe the what is known regarding the relationship between plasma ctDNA and tumor characteristics such as tumor burden, proliferative activity and therapeutic response . Understanding of these relationships is central to developing a fundamental framework for interpretation longitudinal plasma ctDNA measurements in light of other routine measurements such as radiographic assessments and other blood based biomarkers. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Explain the sources and methods of measurement of ctDNA. 2. Describe the relationships between plasma ctDNA, disease burden and therapeutic response. 3. Discuss how these relationships influence the clinical utility of routine plasma ctDNA testing. [12] Quantitative Methods of Monitoring Circulating Tumor DNA. Evan M. Alexander, PhD, Roland Valdes Jr., PhD, DABCC, Mark Linder, PhD, DABCC, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a new, robust biomarker that can be used for early cancer diagnosis, disease prognosis and even guiding treatment through precision medicine. This non-invasive tumor monitoring tool can be performed on the scale of a single gene mutation to an entire sequenced genome. Quantitation of ctDNA is complicated by two factors: wide ranges and low concentrations (0.003%-95% mutant allele frequency (MAF); 5-1500 ng/mL). Currently, the field of monitoring ctDNA is dominated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technologies. Understandably, these different monitoring techniques require specialized analytical instrumentation. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are not universal. There are many considerations a clinician needs to be mindful of when utilizing these technologies to monitor ctDNA (known vs unknown mutation, absolute quantitation vs MAF). Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of ct DNA quantification methods in a given clinical situation is paramount in utilizing this biomarker to its fullest and most appropriate potential. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Identify which quantitation technique for ctDNA is most appropriate to use in a given clinical scenario 2. Recognize the difference between quantitation of mutant allele frequency and absolute quantitation of ctDNA 3. Recognize the importance of assay sensitivity when serially monitoring patient cancer progression. [13] The Value of Next Generation Sequencing in Myeloid Neoplasia. Mustafa Al-Kawaaz, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY This presentation will demonstrate some of the most important utilities of next generation sequencing (NGS) in a spectrum of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and overlap syndromes. Interrogation of nucleic acid (DNA and/or RNA) to look for certain genomic alterations is essential for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Classification of myeloid neoplasms continues to evolve by including entities defined by specific genomic alterations. NGS is an essential utility to guide management decisions. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Recognize changes to classification of myeloid neoplasms and some categories definite by genetic alterations. 2. Identify the utility of different vendors/ platforms offering certain advantages in next generation sequencing. 3. Recommend testing utility by evaluating the targeted genetic alteration as well as clinical scenario. [14] Forecasting clinical behavior and therapeutic response of breast carcinoma using gene expression. James L. Wittliff and Michael W. Daniels, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Our goal is to associate expression of nuclear and peptide hormone receptor genes with biomarker status of breast carcinoma and risk of recurrence, to advance clinical management. Cellular heterogeneity of tissue specimens is a complicating factor in determining analyte (protein or gene) levels of specific cell types. A unique deidentified database was analyzed that contained microarray results of 22,000 genes derived only from total RNA extracted from breast carcinoma cells procured by laser capture microdissection (Pixcell IIe:Arcturus®/ Thermo Fisher) of 247 de-identified primary tissue biopsies. Relative expression levels of each gene candidate for 49 nuclear receptors as well as 61 peptide/protein hormones and 81 of their cognate receptor proteins were selected for this retrospective investigation. Assessment of a patient's risk of recurrence primarily utilizes estrogen (ER) and progestin receptor proteins (PR), quantified by radio-ligand binding (NEN/DuPont) and/or enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Labs). Parameters and clinical outcomes were analyzed by univariable and multivariable Cox regressions, Fisher's Exact Test, Kaplan Meier plots and with R software v4.0.0. Examples of multivariable Cox regression models of candidates of nuclear receptor genes, fit to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), revealed that only NR4A2, PGR, PPARA and THRB were required to predict DFS and NR3C2, PGR and THRB were necessary to predict OS. Of 142 candidate genes for peptide hormones and their cognate receptors, 30 exhibited expression levels that individually predicted DFS and/or OS. When pairs of genes for a peptide hormone and its receptor were evaluated by multivariable Cox Regression with interaction, complexes were identified that predicted DFS and OS (EDN1-ENDRA, GHRL-GHSR, INHBB-ACVR2B, NPY-NPY1R, INHBB-ACVR1B, RLN2-RXFP3 and NPY-NPY6R) based on unadjusted p-value for the interaction term. These investigations also revealed numerous over-expressed genes in carcinomas with poor clinical outcomes suggesting candidates for development of novel therapeutics. Collectively, use of small molecular signatures (gene subsets) with quantified ER/PR protein or ESR1/ PGR expression in a breast carcinoma with clinical outcomes enhanced prediction of risk of recurrence and identification drug development candidates. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. recognize the power of LCM to non-disruptively capture populations of specific cell types for genomics testing, 2. differentiate gene expression patterns based upon protein tumor marker status groups and 3. predict risk of recurrence for patients based upon expression of gene molecular sign. [15] Imaging Mass Spectrometry: Applications in Biomedical Research and Clinical Diagnosis. Yusheng Zhu, PhD; Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA Mass spectrometry tissue imaging is a technology used in mass spectrometry to visualize the spatial distribution of molecules in tissues by their molecular masses. Compared to traditional tissue imaging methods such as immunohistochemistry, mass spectrometry imaging does not need any antibodies and tracers; it can detect and map multiple analytes including proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, metabolites, drugs, toxins, and even elements simultaneously; researchers do not need prior knowledge of molecules in the samples; the analysis can be qualitative and/or quantitative. Therefore, mass spectrometry imaging has become a powerful technology for biomedical research and biomarker discovery. It is widely used in proteomic, peptidomic, lipidomic, glycomic, metabolomic, pharmacological and toxicological studies. This session will introduce common mass spectrometry imaging techniques including matrix assistant laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) imaging, time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) imaging, and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI)-mass spectrometry imaging. In addition, the basic principle, procedure, and application of these methods in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis will be discussed. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Define tissue imaging mass spectrometry. 2. Explain basic principle of common types of imaging mass spectrometry. 3. Describe application of tissue imaging mass spectrometry in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. [16] Immune Landscape in Sentinel Lymph Nodes from Melanoma Patients by Single-Cell Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) Analysis. Kavitha Yaddanapudi, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY We describe the development of a multiscale immune profiling strategy to map the immune landscape of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in our search for tumor-driven immune changes that can guide the design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with early-stage melanoma. We used mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), flow cytometry, and T cell receptor immunosequencing to conduct simultaneous single-cell analyses of immune cells in the SLNs of melanoma patients. We identified unique tumordriven T, NK, and innate immune cell signatures that are present in stage III melanoma-bearing SLNs, but absent in stage I/II non-melanoma-bearing SLNs. We found increased effector-memory T cells and TCR clonality selectively in the melanoma-bearing SLNs relative to non-melanoma-bearing SLNs, consistent with possible activation of an anti-tumor immune response. However, we also observed a markedly immunotolerant environment in the melanoma-bearing SLNs indicated by reduced and impaired NK cells and increased levels of CD8+CD57+PD-1+ cells which are known to display low melanoma killing capabilities. Other changes observed in melanoma-bearing SLNs when compared to non-melanoma bearing SLNs include reduced CD8+CD69+ T cells/T regulatory cells ratio and high PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our data suggests that these immunological changes compromise anti-melanoma immunity and contribute to a high relapse rate. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe mass cytometry analysis of melanoma patient sentinel lymph node samples, identify new immunologic and therapeutic targets for preventing melanoma recurrence and identify unique melanoma-driven immune cell signatures. [17] Application of MassARRAY System in Molecular Diagnostics - Pharmacogenomics and Oncology. Shuko Harada and Alexander C. Mackinnon, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL In molecular diagnostic laboratories, multiplex genetic analysis, for example Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), is increasingly utilized. NGS is expensive, laborious, and requires complicated bioinformatics analysis. The MassARRAY system provides accurate, low cost, facile, multiplexed analysis of hundreds of clinically relevant mutations with relatively simple analytics. In this study, we evaluated the utility of this system for two multiplex, molecular diagnostic applications: detection of somatic variants found in brain (CNS) tumors and germline variants (SNPs) found in metabolic enzymes as part of a pharmacogenomics (PGDX) assay. The CNS assay utilizes a custom design to identify deletions involving chromosomes 1p and 19q and somatic variants in IDH1, IDH2 and TERT. The PGDX panel targets 68 SNPs and several copy number variants (CNV) in 20 metabolic genes implicated in drug metabolisms. Genetic targets are PCR amplified followed by primer extension using allele-specific, specialized primers. Allotypes are detected by the MassARRAY system and results are generated using the MassArray software. Thirty CNS tumor samples with known 1p19q and IDH1/IDH2 mutation status were analyzed using the CNS panel. The results were >95% concordant to orthogonal test results. 48 samples with known various genotypes were analyzed using the PGDX assay. The results were >99% concordant; intra- and inter-run reproducibility was 100% (n=7). Overall, the MassARRAY system is reliable, cost effective and easy to operate. Performance is consistent and analysis is streamlined. The MassARRAY platform has broad application across multiple indications for molecular diagnostic testing. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to understand the utility of MassARRAY system in molecular diagnostics. [18] Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers in clinical practice: analytical and clinical considerations. Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, Susan Ashrafzadeh-Kian, Wentao Li, Michelle R. Campbell, Ronald Petersen, and Joshua Bornhorst, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN This presentation will describe analytical and clinical considerations for the appropriate use of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers: amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ4 2), total Tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau). Changes in these biomarkers reflect key changes in AD pathophysiology and are being incorporated into clinical practice. One of the challenges with the interpretation of CSF biomarkers has been the lack of standardized procedures for sample collection and handling as well as the lack of robust assays to measure these biomarkers. The analytical characteristics of the Roche Elecsys immunoassays for the quantitation of Aβ42, t-Tau, and p-Tau in CSF were established. All assays demonstrated robust analytical performance suitable for clinical laboratory utilization. To evaluate clinical performance, these biomarkers were measured in a cohort of clinically characterized samples (n=161). Using a p-Tau/Aβ42 ratio cutoff of >0.023, 20% of cognitively unimpaired, 41% of mild cognitive impairment, and 100% of AD dementia patients were classified as positive. The use of the p-Tau/Aβ42 ratio showed optimal concordance with amyloid PET exhibiting 100% negative and 86% positive concordance. Finally, the pattern of these biomarkers was evaluated in 535 Mayo Clinic patients that underwent testing as part of a cognitive evaluation over a 1-year period. In 27% of patients all biomarkers were normal and not consistent with AD; in 25% of patients all biomarkers were consistent with AD. A normal p-Tau/ Aβ42 ratio with low/abnormal Aβ42 was observed in 19% of patients and was most often associated with the clinical presentation of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). An abnormal p-Tau/Aβ42 ratio displayed the strongest relationship with AD. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. identify the role of Aβ42, t-Tau, and p-Tau in the differential diagnosis of AD and 2 discuss how various biomarker patterns are associated with other non-AD cognitive disorders. [19] Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2viral RNA detection, using Massarray, RT-qPCR and UltraFast RT-PCR assays. Bene Ekene-Afolabi1, John Patrick Alao1, Solomon Rotimi1,2, and John Bolodeoku1,3, 1ZEAB Therapeutic Ltd. Discovery Park, Ramsgate Road, Sandwich, Kent CF13 9FF, United Kingdom, 2Department of Biochemistry, Covenant University, Ota, Nigeria, and 3JB Consulting MDP Ltd, 1 Bell Street, Maidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 1 BU, United Kingdom The Covid-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed short comings in the global ability to effectively deal with such crises. In particular, the molecular diagnostics market was flooded with a diverse array of RT-PCR kits. These kits target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the United States Centres for Disease Control (CDC) recommended nucleocapsid N1 and N2 genes being the most common. In addition, these kits use various cycling parameters and cut-offs despite being approved for diagnostic testing in various countries. Detailed information on the suitability of these tests for the clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 and their performance under laboratory conditions remain scarce. In this study, three assays evaluated viral genes in synthetic RNA and RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2 samples stored in viral transport medium (VTM) (30 panel certified reference materials), UK NEQAS samples and 100 patient samples: 1) Agilent SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR kit for detecting the N1 and N2; 2) Agena Bioscience MassArray (MALDI-ToF) SARS-CoV-2 for detecting N1, N2, N3, ORF1 & ORF1ab, variant SARS detection, and 3) Molecular Biology System UltraFast RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit for detecting N1, N2, and ORF1ab These assays showed good performance, sensitivity and specificity with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1 copy/ μL. The specificity and sensitivity are 100% and 98% respectively. These kits thus provide a robust assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. Conclusion: These assays are suitable for routine diagnostic. The UltraFast NextGenPCR is the fastest with average time (30mins), followed by Agilent (2 hrs) and MassArray (6hrs). Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to examine, measure and compare results from different assays for SARS detection, evaluate and diagnose accurately, as well as being able to plan, organize and recommend a diagnostic procedure for diagnostic laboratory. Key words: SARS-CoV-2, RNA extraction, RT-PCR, limit of detection, quantification cycle, COVID-19, in vitro diagnostic tests, Agilent, Massarray, Ultrafast. [20] From the Microbiology Lab to the Operating Room: Advanced Development of the MasSpec Pen for Broad Clinical Use. Livia Eberlin, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Ambient ionization mass spectrometry techniques that enable direct, gentle, and rapid analysis of samples offer exciting opportunities to provide clinicians with rich molecular data to enhance decision-making. Here, an overview of several ongoing clinical projects in the Eberlin laboratory related to the development of a handheld MSbased device, the MasSpec Pen technology, for improving patient care will be discussed. In particular, I will describe results centered around our efforts in employing the MasSpec Pen for intraoperative tissue analysis and cancer detection, identification of infectious microorganisms, and detection of drugs of abuse. Current challenges and opportunities towards incorporating this technology into clinical practice will also be addressed. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. describe operating principles of direct mass spectrometry techniques for rapid molecular analysis that are being explored for clinical use; 2. evaluate analytical and diagnostic performance metrics of direct mass spectrometry techniques to address unmet clinical needs. [21] Triggered MRM for Urine Drug Testing: Finding What You Aren't Looking For. Joshua Hayden, Norton Healthcare, Louisville, KY This work aimed to develop a triggered multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for urine drug testing that allows simultaneous targeted quantitation of commonly used/abused drugs and qualitative detection of a larger array of uncommonly used drugs. Targeted quantitation is most often accomplished with triple quadruple mass spectrometers but these instruments suffer in their ability to do untargeted analysis. This limitation is especially challenging given the ever increasing number of drugs that are produced and abused-including fentanyl analogues, bath salts, and a broad group of drugs known as spice. Ideally, clinical laboratories would be able to perform both targeted quantitation and some level of qualitative detection of infrequently encountered drugs. Towards this end, we developed a method that allows us to utilize our triple quadruple mass spectrometer to do targeted quantitation of commonly used/ abused drugs and qualitative detection of a larger range of drugs. This qualitative detection is accomplished using a triggered MRM method and a spectral database. To validate this method, deidentified, remnant urine samples were spiked with a variety of uncommonly encountered illicit drugs including various spice derivatives, bath salts, and fentanyl derivatives. The performance of the method was evaluated based on its ability to perform accurate quantitation of targeted compounds and its ability to qualitatively detect the presence of the spiked drugs. The method demonstrated excellence performance. The success of this method suggests such an approach could find widespread use in clinical laboratories; however, questions remain with regards to the regulatory requirements (quality control, proficiency testing, etc). Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1 .Describe the advantages and limitations of triple quadruple mass spectrometers, 2. Discuss the advantage of screening for a wide array of illicit drugs, 3.Summarize how a triggered MRM method might add value to a urine drug assay. [22] Advances in the assessment of Orexin-A (hypocretin-1) deficiency in the diagnosis of Type 1 Narcolepsy. Joshua Bornhorst, Bethany Larson, and Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN This presentation will describe the clinical performance s of an assay for orexin-A (also known as hypocretin-1), which is a neuropeptide involved in the sleep/wake cycle. Impairment of orexin-A production and orexin-A modulated neurotransmission is associated with narcolepsy with cataplexy (episodes of muscle weakness in response to emotional stimuli), and deficiency of orexin-A in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a hallmark of type 1 narcolepsy. The diagnostic criteria for type 1 narcolepsy in the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (2014) includes the presence of cataplexy and/ or measured CSF orexin concentrations less than or equal to 110 pg/mL. However, clinical testing for orexin-A in CSF had been unavailable in the United States. A competitive radioimmunoassay for orexin-A quantitation in CSF was characterized for clinical use in the diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy. This assay demonstrates acceptable analytical precision, accuracy, and stability. To evaluate clinical performance, 100 residual CSF specimens from individuals without suspicion of type 1 narcolepsy all exhibited orexin-A concentrations of >200 pg/mL (mean: 531pg/mL). Additionally, samples from 20 patients with clinical suspicion of type 1 narcolepsy were evaluated. All nine confirmed 9 type 1 narcolepsy patients exhibited orexin concentrations of <50 pg/mL. All 11 patients that were subsequently deemed to have hypersomnias other than type 1 narcolepsy had orexin concentrations of >200pg/mL (range 352-600 pg/mL). Clinical introduction of this test fulfilled a pressing diagnostic need for differentiation of type 1 narcolepsy from other causes of hypersomnolence. Emerging information on how this assay compares to other methods of patient assessment for potential type 1 narcolepsy will also be discussed. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to identify the role of orexin deficiency in type 1 narcolepsy as well as recommend appropriate testing for the evaluation of individuals who potential have this disorder. [23] Zika outbreak in Dominican Republic 2016: A review. Frederick L. Kiechle1, Angelica Freddo1, and Henry Quezada2. 1Pompano Beach, FL and 2Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic We mined the data in the Biorepository at Boca Biolistics obtained during the Zika outbreak for symptomatic pregnant (PG) and non-pregnant (NP) women in the Dominican Republic in 2016. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus transmitted in humans by Aedes mosquitoes. There was a biphasic distribution of 305 symptomatic (NP) and 65 (PG) women (266 NAAT positive by Hologic, Aptima ZIKV assay) in April and late May/June 2016. To determine previous exposure to dengue (DENV) infection, anti-DENV IgG was measured in serum or plasma by ELISA (Euroimmun). (Science 2019; 363: 307). In 65 symptomatic PG women the outcome was 4.6 % spontaneous abortion, 2 % fetal demise and 4.6 % other. We evaluated the presence of 6 presenting symptoms and 3 lab tests (Aptima ZIKA assay; EUROIMMUN ELISA IgG; CDC MAC-ELISA ZiKV IgM - performed by FL Dept of Health) over 8 time intervals (12 - 36 repeat PG or NP patients per interval; total PR 131, total NP 171). The prevalence of 4 symptoms were less frequent in PG women vs NP, including fever, severe eye pain, head pain and joint and muscle pain. Conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in PG vs NP and rash had an equal occurrence. ZIKV IgG and MAC-ELISA-IgM were positive with similar frequency in both groups 1 through 8. NAAT ZIKV results were positive for all 8 intervals (87.5% to 72.2%) in PG patients and in NP (52% in interval 1 and 0.0 to 4.0% in intervals 2 to 8). PG patients with rash were 98% positive for DENV IgG. In conclusion, NP and PG women exhibited a biphasic spike of ZIKV positive infections; from 0 to 86 days post symptoms, PG exhibited a lower prevalence of fever, head pain, severe eye pain and joint and muscle pain compared to NP ZIKV symptomatic patients. The results suggest that PG provides protection from clinical symptoms compared to NP during infection cycle in spite of persistent viremia in PG vs NP. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe the clinical and laboratory findings in Zika infection and differences in PG and NP patient presentation. [24] Rapidly evolving and fatal miliary tuberculosis and COVID-19 infection inan infant.Anindita Ghosh1,Amanda Tchakarov1, Norma Perez1, Nina Tatevian2, Meenakshi Bhattacharjee1. 1University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, and 2Women and Infant Hospital of Rhode Island, Providence, RI Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are two important infectious diseases causing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Active TB infection can stimulate host immune responses and together with COVID-19, may lead to cytokine storm and immune dysregulation leading to multi-organ failure. Studies have reported flare up of pulmonary TB after SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults. We present a unique case of both miliary tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in an infant, indicating that children can acquire both infections concurrently, and have rapid progression with fatal outcome. Case: Our patient was a 6-month-old previously healthy term boy. He had persistent cough and congestion, became severely ill, and was brought to emergency department. Chest X-ray showed diffuse alveolar and interstitial airspace opacities. He was found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR test. Laboratory studies showed pancytopenia with left shift, elevated transaminases (ALT 77, AST 313), low albumin, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 103, IL-6 19000), and abnormal coagulation profile with coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He developed strokes, severe sepsis and electrolyte abnormalities, and declined rapidly with death within 6 days. Autopsy examination showed hepatosplenomegaly. His lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen showed multifocal micro-abscesses, which on microscopic examination showed necrotic foci teeming with mycobacteria, and were culture positive for M. tuberculosis, i.e. miliary tuberculosis. Neuropathological examination showed infarction in the right middle and posterior cerebral artery territories. Conclusions: This patient helps illuminate some immunological and pathological aspects of two co-occurring infectious diseases and the susceptibility for development of fatal complications with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. Upon completion this activity the learner will be able to: 1. recognition of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection cooccurrence with another infectious disease in children. 2. challenges in treatment of COVID-19 infection with other/associated infectious disease. 3. recognition of the complexity of pathological processes in childhood infectious disease. [25] A Postulated Cross Talk between Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and IGFBP-7 May Suggest a Critical Role in Carcinogenesis. Fan Shen1 and Consolato M. Sergi1,2. 1Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada and 2Anatomic Pathology Division, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada Objective: The insulin/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have crucial tasks in the growth, differentiation, and proliferation of healthy and pernicious cells. They are involved in coordinated complexes, including receptors, ligands, binding proteins, and proteases. However, the systems can become dysregulated in tumorigenesis. Insulinlike growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is a protein belonging to the IGFBP superfamily. We intended to explore the cross-talk between IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7. Methods: Analysis of text/ data mining tools using the NCBI platform was used. Results: Numerous studies have provided evidence that IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 are involved in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, among many others. Still, very few suggest an interaction between these two molecules. We found that both proteins share some crucial signaling pathways. P53, and growth inhibitory agents, including retinoic acid (RA), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and anti-estrogens, can give rise to increased expression of IGFBP-3. IGFBP-7 can regulate the growth-suppressing effects of the TGF-β superfamily, and similarly the expression of IGFBP-7 can be upregulated by cellular treatment with TGF-β1 and RA. Conclusions: A comprehensive overview of the relationship between IGFBP-3, IGFBP-7, and cancer highlighted the IGFBP-3 crosstalk with IGFBP-7, which may suggest a promotion other than initiation in carcinogenesis. Upon completion of this learning activity participants should be able to: 1. to define to role of Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein superfamily in carcinogenesis 2. to compare the respective role of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP7 in cancer 3. to determine the relevance of a cross talk between IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-7 for carcinogenesis [26] Measure Directly, Treat Efficiently. Critical Bleeding Management at the Speed of Sound. Oksana Volod, Cedars Sinai, Los Angeles, CA, USA Viscoelastic Testing (VET) is a category of functional whole blood tests used to assay hemostatic competence and optimize blood product transfusions in patients during or after surgical procedures where acute bleeding may occur. Efficient use of these tests has become an elevated need for a comprehensive patient blood management program. Cup and pin legacy systems and those that display the traditional interpretation \"curves\", such as with thromboelastography (TEG®) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®), require varying levels of oversight to maintain compliance and optimal efficient clinical use. Over the last decade, advances have been made with the integration of cartridge-based VET systems to improve upon those legacy systems. During this presentation, the legacy and new generation VETs available in the US are compared based on their unique hemostatic parameters that define contributions of coagulation factors, fibrinogen/fibrin, platelets, and clot lysis as related to the lifespan of a clot. The balance between the needs to act on relevant critical data in near real-time and compliance with the laboratory that must ensure quality is also discussed. The Quantra® system is the newest VET. It is a fully sealed, cartridgebased, automated, four-channel device that provides the fastest hemostasis assessment (12 minutes on average). The Quantra is based on a new ultrasound technology termed sonic estimation of elasticity via resonance (SEER). The important differences between Quantra and other VETs are its ease of interpretation, optimizations for use at the point of patient need, and its ability to directly measure blood viscoelastic properties. Through real case examples, this talk will also focus on Quantra specific hemostasis alterations and optimal management strategies for bleeding patients. Upon completion of this learning activity participants should be able to: 1. Describe Viscoelastic Testing as part of a Patient Blood Management initiative. 2. Categorize various viscoelastic assay methods and classify clinical and operational needs related to implementation and accessibility (i.e., speed, ease of use and location) 3. Interpret and explain the results of Quantra via participation in real-world case example. [27] Managing the challenges of running a transfusion service during the COVID-19 pandemic Claire Meena-Leist, Amanda Riggs and Mohamed Elkady, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY Hospitals have developed systems to adjust to periodic blood product shortages. Apheresis platelets and group O Rh(D) negative red blood cell shortages are common during summer months and holidays and can be managed well by having a strong blood management program and obtaining contracts with secondary blood suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, caused historic blood product shortages that resulted in red blood cell rationing and requests from our primary blood supplier for hospitals to consider canceling non-urgent surgical procedures. With virtually no lead time, in December 2021, our blood supplier began rationing all group O red blood cells to their customers. For the first time blood was allotted to customers based on blood center supply, not patient need. The rationing quickly expanded to include all group A and B red blood cells, with no information about how long the shortage would last. Hospitals were forced to develop more creative blood management methods, and to develop criteria for surgery cancellations. We discuss our experience with providing patient care in a hospital system that includes the region's only American College of Surgeons (ACS) Verified Level 1 Trauma centers for adults in the Commonwealth of KY. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. Describe how one hospital system approached blood management during a historic blood shortage 2. Explain why hospital blood management is not the sole answer to providing patient care during extreme blood shortages 3. Identify ways that blood centers can improve strategic planning for the next pandemic. [28] Cells,wells, & spells: the evolution of HLA testing methods. Tiffany K Bratton, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY Organ transplantation is a life-saving treatment modality for patients with end stage organ failure. However, allograft rejection remains an obstacle for long term outcomes. An evolution in the understanding of transplant immunology over the past fifty years has led to continuous development and improvement of methods for detecting, not only HLA antibodies, but also other markers of the overall immune status of transplant patients. HLA testing began in the 1960's with donor cells; the cytotoxic crossmatch caused a paradigm shift in transplantation with immediate improvements in short term outcomes. In the early 2000's the organ allocation system was radically changed by the development of solid phase technology. This presentation will cover the evolution of HLA testing methods from the very beginning to current state as well as speculation on new technologies that could be developed and used to continue to improve long term outcomes for transplant patients. Upon completion of this learning activity participants should be able to: 1. Describe the different testing methods used for detection of HLA sensitization. 2. Identify the current HLA testing methods. 3. Evaluate new technologies that may be developed for both HLA and overall transplant testing. [29] The CNS-penetrating taxane drug TPI 287 potentiates the antiglioma activity of the AURKA inhibitor alisertib in vivo. Müge Sak, Brian J. Williams, Cory T. Zumbar, Mustafa N. G. Al-Kawaaz, Aastha Kakar, Andrew J. Hey, Leslie M. Scheir, Landon Teer, Joseph Chen and Norman L. Lehman. University of Louisville, Louisville KY Glioblastoma, IDH wildtype (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and has a poor prognosis. We previously found cytotoxic synergy between the AURKA inhibitor alisertib and the novel CNS-penetrating taxane TPI 287 against GBM tumor stem-like cells in vitro. Here we used an orthotopic human GBM xenograft mouse model to test the ability of TPI 287 to potentiate alisertib's antitumor activity in vivo. At two weeks, animal tumor volume was significantly decreased by alisertib, TPI 287, and combination treatments compared to controls. At four weeks both alisertib and TPI 287 groups had reduced tumor volume and a statistically significant decrease was again observed in the combination therapy group. Alisertib monotherapy improved animal survival, which was further improved with the addition of TPI 287 (p=0.0058). TPI 287 alone did not significantly improve animal survival. We also investigated the mechanism of apoptotic synergy between alisertib and TPI 287. Alisertib + TPI 287 combination treatment decreased Bcl-2 levels in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, this treatment increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Bak in synchronized GBM cells. Bim knockdown by siRNA inhibited synergistic cytotoxicity caused by alisertib + TPI 287 (p=0.0042). These results suggest that these drugs cause synergistic apoptosis in GBM cells partially through effects on Bcl-2 family proteins. Additionally, both alisertib and TPI 287 significantly reduced GBM cell invasion (p<0.0001). However, this effect was greater with TPI 287, and the drug combination was no more effective at inhibiting invasion than TPI 287 alone. These findings support the potential use of this combination therapy against GBM in clinical trials. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to understand the Bcl-2 family protein apoptotic cascade, the mechanism of action of taxanes and AURKA inhibitors and the rationale for combination treatment for GBM. [30] SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in the post-vaccine era: comparing assays for standardization. Sarrah Lahorewala and Xin Yi, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX The interpretation of results of various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is challenging due to non-standardization among assays. The aims of this study were: to compare three commonly used semi-quantitative/quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests with our institutional Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA assay; and, to validate the ELISA assay against known National Standard (CRM-NIBSC21/234), thus correlating calculated ELISA concentrations (U/ mL) and the international standard units for binding assay formats, i.e. Binding Antibody Units/mL (BAU/ mL). The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA assay detects IgG antibodies against the viral anti-S Ectodomain. The three commercial tests compared to the ELISA assay were the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2S (U/mL), Siemens Atellica COV2G (Index) and VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quantitative (BAU/mL). The Roche and Siemens test comparisons included 95 patient samples, with 51 samples evaluated for the VITROS assay. Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism9 software. We mapped the antibody concentrations obtained on the ELISA assay against that of CRM-NIBSC21/234 and validated their linear relationship. The commercial assays evaluated showed good correlation with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA, across all ELISA titers. The corresponding assay result ranges (lower and upper 95% CI of mean) for each titer group is as follows: <1:50: Roche: <0.4-<0.4; Siemens: 0.0070.020; Vitros: 1.854-4.606; 1:50: Roche: 26.01-88.39; Siemens: 0.585-0.966; Vitros: 33.47-50.83; 1:150: Roche: 622.9-1095; Siemens: 6.82-214.38; Vitros: 52.35-141.4; 1:450: Roche: 1321-2091; Siemens: 16.74-19.55; Vitros: 112.4-192.2; 1:1350: Roche: 2067->2500; Siemens: >20->20; Vitros: >200->200. The calculated concentration (U/mL) obtained by the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike ELISA and the expected concentration of CRM were strongly correlated and results were found to be linear in the range from 3.25-832 BAU/mL covering titers ranging from <1:50 to >1:1350. The calibration of our ELISA assay to the International Standard, and its correlation with commercial assays, allows for standardization between assays and a better understanding of the various antibody titers in the context of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe the clinical utility of antibody testing in SARS-CoV-2 2. Understand the various kinds of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests commonly utilized 3. Interpret results of commonly used semi-quantitative/quantitative assays and correlate assay titers with the International Standard Units (BAU/ mL). [31] How to be a better surgical pathology consultant. Neda Zarrin-Khameh, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Consultation on surgical pathology specimens is part of the daily professional practice of every pathologist. We evaluated the characteristics of a good consultant and the habits that should be avoided. A 1-page questionnaire was prepared to evaluate how pathologists select their consultants. The questionnaire was emailed to 106 pathologists. Fifty-eight pathologists completed the questionnaire (55% response rate). The most important criteria for a consultant were knowledge and expertise. Accessibility, turnaround time, and teaching (providing explanation about the case) were selected next for choosing a consultant. The 2 factors that contributed to avoiding a consultant were expensive workup and changing the diagnosis. Open questions about \"definition of best/worst consultant,\" \"when to change the consultant,\" and \"if the criteria for consultant have changed over time\" provided additional valuable information. Accessibility, short turnaround time, and teaching are the most important reasons for selecting a consultant. Performing an expensive workup and being in the habit of changing the diagnosis are the factors that make a consultant less favorable. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. recognize three characteristics of a consultant that are important for requesting consultation, 2. identify three characteristics that are not recommended for a consultant and 3. determine when a pathologists may decide to change their consultant. [32] The Diagnostic Role of Fusion-Gene Analysis in Ambiguous Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Haider A. Mejbel, Alexander C. Mackinnon, and Shuko Harada, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Department of Pathology, Birmingham, The diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma often requires adequate clinicopathologic correlation as well as the appropriate application of immunohistochemical studies. However, certain ambiguous/undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas can pose a diagnostic challenge. We retrospectively reviewed the cases submitted for RNA-based fusion panel (Archer FusionPlex assay) to evaluate the diagnostic utility of fusion gene analysis in soft tissue sarcomas. Herein we present the clinicopathologic and molecular alterations of three challenging soft tissue sarcomas, on which, the application of fusion-gene analysis has entirely altered the initial diagnosis. These cases include Ewing sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma with melanocytic differentiation, and MEIS1::NOCA1 sarcoma that were initially diagnosed as carcinoid tumor of the lung, melanoma, and low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, respectively. In addition to providing the valuable prognostic information, the application of fusion-gene analysis has resulted in the reclassification of these neoplasms and altered the type of therapy. Currently, all patients are alive at the 6-, 26-, and 4-month of their final diagnosis. In conclusion, although adequate histopathologic examination and extensive immunohistochemical study were performed, the final diagnoses and classification of these sarcomas were only rendered after the application of the appropriate molecular testing. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to understand the role of molecular fusiongene analysis in further classifying ambiguous soft tissue sarcomas that can help arrive at the accurate diagnosis, alter disease stage, and inform therapy. [33] Distinct lesions of host defense and bacterial offense in tuberculosis. Robert L. Hunter and Robert E. Brown, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX The continued existence of M. tuberculosis depends on production of two distinct disease processes in humans. Primary tuberculosis (TB), the host's defense, protects against disseminated infection. Post-primary TB, in contrast, is the bacteria's offense. It facilitates transmission of infection to new hosts. Host defense is mediated by granulomas as are widely studied in human TB and animal models. People may succumb to lack of defense with disseminated infection, but this does not benefit the organism since it also dies. Bacterial offense, the lesions that mediate transmission of infection to new hosts, is mediated by post-primary TB. It begins as a subclinical obstructive lobular pneumonia that slowly accumulates materials for a sudden massive necrotizing pneumonia that can be coughed out to produce a cavity from which the organism can escape to infect new people. The early lesions of post-primary TB were well known to investigators in the preantibiotic era when autopsies were cutting edge science, but are unknown to the majority of current investigators who study only animal models. While modern technologies are making unprecedented progress in understanding tuberculous granulomas, they are making very little in understanding post-primary TB that does not exist in most animal models. Fortunately, new multiplex technologies make it possible to study human FFPE slides with great depth and precision. Such studies are necessary to gain a better understanding to the key developmental stage of TB. Upon completion of the activity, participants should be able to recognize and describe the differences between primary and post-primary TB. [34] Agonal-stress vesicles in critically ill children confused with microvesicular steatosis. John Hicks, Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX Background: Acute or prolonged systemic organ failure, perinatal demise, or unexpected death in the neonates and children raises a concern for metabolic, lysosomal storage or mitochondrial diseases and infectious etiologies. A potential pitfall is the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles particularly within hepatocytes that appear as microvesicular steatosis on routine staining. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis may indicate lipid metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Ultrastructural examination (EM) is useful in identifying abnormal lipid accumulation, mitochondrial structural abnormalities, and metabolic and lysosomal storage diseases. Particular structures indicative of post-mortem agonal or pre-mortem stress have been termed agonal-stress vesicles. It has not been shown, that these agonal-stress vesicles contain acute phase reactants in response to cellular ischemic or asphyxia. Design: EM laboratory archives were searched for cases with vesicles fitting the ultrastructural features of agonal-stress vesicles. 40 cases (20 males; 20 females) were identified with liver tissue submitted for routine processing (paraffin-embedded formalin fixed) and EM. Study population had variety of medical conditions associated with ischemic and asphyxial stress. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) with acute phase reactant antibodies was performed (c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-chymotrypsin). Results: All routinely stained liver tissue sections shows variably-sized vacuoles within hepatocyte cytoplasm, mimicking microvesicular steatosis. IHC for acute phase reactants highlighted the vacuoles with all antibodies (c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, alpha-2-macroglobulin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-chymotrypsin), with greatest intensity with alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-1-chymotrypsin. EM showed frequent vesicles with limiting membranes, containing finely granular, homogeneous content. Conclusion: Agonal-stress vesicles are under recognized structure and may be interpreted as microvesicular steatosis, leading to a workup for metabolic or mitochondrial disease. EM assists in identifying these structures as agonal-stress vesicles. Also, residual formalin-fixed, frozen tissue and tissue recovered from paraffin tissue blocks may be utilized for EM. IHC for acute phase reactants in this study confirms the contents of agonal-stress vacuoles being acute phase reactants. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe the histopathologic, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features of agonal-stress vacuoles. [35] Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): A Tool often Underused for Pediatric Small Round Blue Cell Tumors opening New Venues for Single-Cell Technologies. Consolato M. Sergi1,2, 1Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, and 2Anatomic Pathology Division, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada Aims: Pediatric small round blue cell tumors (PSRBCT) are an intriguing and challenging collection of neoplasms. Light microscopy of small round blue cell tumors identifies small round cells. Pediatric small round blue cell tumors include several entities, such as nephroblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, malignant lymphoma, and small cell osteosarcoma among others. The differential diagnosis of these neoplasms may be controversial at a light microscopy level, even using immunohistochemistry. A faint staining or an ambiguous background can deter pathologists from making the proper diagnostic decision. Methods: A review of the personal experience at four centers is considered here. In addition, single cell technologies are added to renew the interest of TEM. Results: Molecular biology may provide an overwhelming amount of data challenging to distinguish them, and some translocations may be seen in more than one category. Thus, TEM can be extremely valuable. In particular, tumor cells associated with tangles of cytoplasmic processes containing neurosecretory granules can diagnose neuroblastoma. Conversely, a marked variation in size, shape and cytoplasmic differentiation with most tumor cells containing prominent dilated cisterns of rough endoplasmic reticulum and bundles of thick and thin filaments with well-formed Z-bands may infer the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. The presence of an intracytoplasmic deposit of glycogen may suggest Ewing's sarcoma. At the same time, a cellular arrangement in a tubular configuration with a well-formed basal lamina may advocate the diagnosis of nephroblastoma. Single-cell sequencing are booming. Conclusion: Single-cell sequencing technologies are useful to discover the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and epigenome of single cells. These techniques can show the differences and evolutionary relationships of innumerable cells. Here, we speculate that TEM may have an intriguing role for single-cell sequencing technologies and their applications in oncology, microbiology, reproductive and environmental sciences emphasizing the essential role that single-cell sequencing methods play in these areas. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. To define to general role of TEM in pathology. 2. To identify the role of TEM for PSRBCTs. 3. To determine the relevance in applying new technologies to TEM studies. [36] Chondroid Chordoma Presenting as Oropharyngeal Mass in Pediatrics. John Hicks, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX Introduction: Chordoma is a low to intermediate grade malignancy, resembling embryonal notochord. This tumor occurs in sacrococcygeal (60%), craniocervical (25%, clivus most common) and vertebral (15%) sites. Chordoma is a rare tumor (incidence 5/10,000,000; 2% of bone tumors). Peak incidence is in 4th decade. Clinical Presentation and Pathology Findings: 8 year-old girl with asthma history presented with 6-12 months of progressively worsening snoring, muffled voice and saliva pooling, attributed to seasonal allergies. Upon oral examination, a firm, protruding right tonsillar bed (oropharyngeal) mass with intact overlying vascularized mucosa was noted. Limited CT imaging identified an oropharyngeal mass with bony destruction. Biopsy was performed which showed a hyalinized chondroid to cartilaginous mass. Tumor cells immunoreacted with brachyury, EMA, S100 and SOX9, while negative for D2-40, with retained nuclear INI-1. Low-grade chondroid chordoma diagnosis was rendered. Molecular tumor testing identified p53 mutation, and KMT2B and ROS1 mutations of unknown significance. Conventional tumor karyotype was 46,XX. Germline testing was negative for p53 mutation. Additional imaging identified an 8.5 cm clivus origin tumor. The patient underwent additional surgery for tumor debulking, followed by oncologic (radiationtherapy) management. Conclusion: Chondroid chordoma involving oro/nasopharyngeal region is rare (0.2% of oro/nasopharyngeal tumors). Differential diagnosis includes chondrosarcoma, chordoid meningioma, myoepithelioma/myoepithelial carcinoma, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and chordoid meningioma. Treatment is surgical, with complete resection difficult due to anatomic location. Although the tumor tends to be radioresistant, high-dose radiation therapy is usuallyemployed. Overall survival with aggressive surgery is up to 75% at 5yrs and up to 65% at 10yrs. Recurrence is common (up to 90% at 10 years). Chondroid variant has somewhat better prognosis. Sonic hedgehog homolog protein gene (7q33), T (brachyury) gene duplication (6q27), and TSC1 or TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis) gene inactivation are associated with chordoma. Autosomal dominant familial tumors associated with T gene duplication are rare. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to describe the clinical, radiologic histopathologic, immunohistochemistry and molecular features in the diagnosis of chordoma. [37] Deciduosis adjacent an ileouterine fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease: Case report and literature review. Lance Truong1, Yigit Baykara1, and Nina Tatevian2. 1Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI and 2Women & Infants Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI Deciduosis is a rare diagnosis which refers to extrauterine decidual tissue, found usually in adjacent gynecological structures including the cervix and ovaries, and more rarely in the peritoneum and in other abdominal organs. Fistulas are a known and frequent complication of Crohn's disease, commonly involving adjacent bowel and rarely involving gynecological structures. Here, we report a case of deciduosis of the distal ileum occurring in the setting of long-standing Crohn's disease in a 34-year-old patient at 31 5/7 weeks of gestation, admitted to our hospital with acute right lower quadrant pain. Imaging was suggestive of complex fistulae and abscess formation. She underwent a cesarean delivery followed by hysterectomy and ileocolectomy with an ileouterine fistula tract leading to a complex subserosal uterine abscess on intraoperative and pathological gross examination. On histological examination, a focus of ectopic decidua adjacent the fistula was incidentally found on H&E section. Review of the current literature on gastrointestinal deciduosis identified nine publications reporting cases primarily involving the appendix and only a single previously reported case involving the ileum. Crohn's disease cases with reported ileouterine fistulas are extremely rare, with only four previously reported cases in the literature. The utility in recognizing this extremely rare presentation is in avoiding misinterpreting this entity as a neoplastic process. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. define deciduosis, 2. recognize complications associated with Crohn's disease, 3. compare neoplastic mimickers of ectopic decidual tissue [38] Modern implementation of Digital Pathology with Artificial Intelligence in an Academic Medical Center. Dibson Dibe Gondim, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at University of Louisville, KY Digital pathology refers to the digital transformation of histopathology - turning histologic tissue sections into multi-gigabyte whole slide images. These images can be evaluated by quantitative and reproducible computational techniques, including artificial intelligence-based algorithms. While the value of this technology has been increasingly recognized, clinical adoption has been limited in most of the world, including in the United States. Our academic center and health care system have embraced the concept of digital pathology and artificial intelligence. My goal is to present the digital pathology implementation proposal and discuss our progress. Overall, digital pathology implementation tends to be a slow process occurring over years. However, we decided that the technology was mature enough for an accelerated adoption plan. From the beginning, we focused on 100% prospective glass slide scanning 100%, in contrast with most institutions which start with limited retrospective scanning. To achieve this, we created a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pathology, histotechnology, project management, software engineering, and data science. We integrated scanning in the histology laboratory using LEAN principles and updated our staining equipment to allow compatibility with the slide scanners. We installed high-throughput slide scanners that require minimal user experience or training. We adopted cloud-based software as the platform product from a vendor with expertise in artificial intelligence. This software platform provides image viewer, worklist, storage, and artificial intelligence-based algorithms. Cloud storage allowed us to scale our operation without major overhead. We started scanning 100% of slides in less than 9 months after the beginning of the project. We deployed the integration interface and the first FDA-approved artificial intelligence-based tool in the testing environment within months. Our experience shows that the current technologies allow for an accelerated adoption of digital pathology. However, advanced understanding of digital pathology technologies and assembling a multidisciplinary task force have been instrumental in determining how to best put together all the pieces and to overcome multiple challenges that emerged during the implementation period. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. understand how digital pathology fits in the clinical workflow, 2. describe digital pathology implementation strategies, and 3. explain how integration of multiple hospital and laboratory information systems for a productive user experience.

[41] Data literacy in healthcare: a vital component of precision medicine. Joyce J. Ou, Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, RI The accelerating volume of heterogenous, multimodal data that is generated in modern healthcare highlights an urgent need for data literacy across a broad range of stakeholders. As information sources, analytics, and use cases rapidly evolve, data-powered augmented intelligence is becoming a major driver of precision medicine. The growing influence of machine generated insights on decisionmaking underscores the importance of ensuring that health data producers and consumers have the skills to critically evaluate, interpret, communicate, and act on these insights. Data literacy has, at times, been equated with specific data science tools and processes. However, fluency with data in the current era requires additional knowledge of its value and limitations with respect to data life cycles and governance, along with technical, social, and ethical implications. To achieve this breadth of understanding, a practical framework can be developed to identify and address gaps in data literacy. This framework focuses on identifying core categories of data skills, assessing stakeholder roles and needs relative to these categories, and developing processes for continuous learning. Implementation of such a model can promote systemic innovation by enabling individuals to stay current with the pace of technological changes that impact all stages of precision medicine discovery and delivery. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to 1. Identify core competencies needed to achieve healthcare data literacy 2. Evaluate the impact of a data literacy framework on promoting collaborations between data producers and consumers in precision medicine 3. Describe a data education model that supports continuous learning for healthcare stakeholders. [42] Digital health applications and key characteristics related to at-home testing outcomes. Lee B. Springer, Brio Systems, Bellevue, OH Digital health technology applications (DHT) have been minimally utilized to support at-home rapid testing in the past. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, their use has increased significantly. One of the primary contributors to this growth is the widespread adoption of at-home testing throughout the progression of the pandemic to increase the publics access to testing. Given the increased need for at-home testing, digital health technology applications have been utilized to aid users throughout all testing processes and efficiently document results. These applications are considered to play a vital role in ensuring optimal accuracy of the test device and facilitate public health reporting. A step-by-step systematic analysis of digital health technology supporting at-home point-of-care testing was performed to identify key areas of task related dependence to predicted outcome in relation to technological support. The aim of the analysis was to assess the quality and features in relation to engagement during testing phases utilizing the mobile application rating scale (MARS). This analysis included 27 digital health applications designed to complement at-home testing for glucose, creatinine, coagulation, hemoglobin A1c, and SARS-CoV-2 with more than 5,000 downloads or registered users. A nonparametric rank sum test was used to determine correlating performance between sections of the mobile application rating scale and aligned testing phases. High scores in pre-analytical and post-analytical sections of the mobile application rating scale correlated to an overall high level of satisfaction and desired outcome. Additional correlations were seen between sections related to overall functionality, and applications viewed to support pre-analytical processes effectively, these were deemed as being able to consistently produce better patient and result outcomes. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to identify digital health technology that would optimize accurate results, predict overall patient engagement in clinical application and design clinical practices around digital health technology to optimize patient outcomes. [43] Validation of Artificial Intelligence-Based System for Prostate Cancer Detection and Grading. Tarymé López Díaz and Dibson Dibe Gondim, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at University of Louisville, KY Paige Prostate Detect (Paige.AI Inc., New York, USA) is the first FDA-approved artificial intelligence (AI)-based system created to assist pathologists to detect and grade prostate cancer. Our goal is to present the results of a validation study of this system in an academic center. 40 prostate biopsy cases were randomly selected from a list of 60 consecutive cases. All HE-stained slides (619) were scanned in a Leica Aperio GT450 (400x magnification). Paige Prostate Detect was applied to each slide and results were compared with the original diagnoses. Diagnostic discrepancies were evaluated by pathologists. AI output was recorded for each whole slide image. On the other hand, pathologists provided results based on the evaluation of two or more glass slides per biopsy location. 36 disagreements were identified (5.8%) in all slides. Agreement on the case level required that all slides of a case had concordant diagnosis between AI-system and pathologist. 16/40 cases had disagreements. The AI-system helped to detect focal cancer in a case with no prior definitive cancer diagnosis. Multiple discrepancies related to atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) were identified. Since the system was not trained to make a diagnosis of ASAP, these cases were either diagnosed as carcinoma or benign. Validation of pathology AI-systems is essential before clinical adoption. This system shows potential to locate low-volume cancer in cases with no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. In the case of ASAP, pathologists should use well-defined criteria to render this diagnosis and should not rely on AI impression. [44] Respiratory Pathology of Acute Respiratory distress Syndrome (ARDS). Henry Oh, PhD, FACSc, FRSB, FAPSR, RRT, MT, CSci, Health Occupations Department, Idaho State University, Pocatello, ID The body's immune system response to infection is primarily an inflammation. Cytokines cause inflammation of tissue by making the cell walls of blood vessels become more permeable, thus allowing leakage of blood with immune cells into the surrounding tissue to start the healing process of the damaged tissue. The inflammation is triggered by the release of cytokines from interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Cells that release cytokines include leucocytes or interleukins, neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and many other cells. When the inflammatory response go out of control, it can cause more harm to the lungs in COVID-19 infection where cytokines can destroy normal, healthy alveoli. Cytokine storm occurs when there is an overwhelming inflammatory response due to the increase release of cytokines. The inflammatory cytokines \"storms\" the lungs which is the leading cause of mortality rates in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU. Accumulated dead cells and other debris in the lungs can set the stage for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The effects of cytokine storm amplify the severity and extent of ARDS. In ARDS, the alveoli become filled with dead cells, debris and leaked fluids from damaged interstitial cells. The lungs become stiff because of very low compliance. Oxygen saturation levels fall below 90% and the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) fall below 60 mmHg which can lead to severe hypoxemia. Patients with ARDS develop refractory hypoxemia which is unresponsive to oxygen therapy. Patient needs to be intubated and connected to a ventilator. The positive pressure effects of mechanical ventilation may not be adequate to improve the oxygenation status of the patient. Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) would need to be added to keep the oxygen saturation at 90%. However, caution must be observed when ventilating patients with high positive pressure since this can cause detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system. It can decrease blood pressure, cardiac output, urine output leading to cardiovascular collapse, multi-organ failure, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Monitoring of fluids and electrolytes, vital signs, lung compliance, blood gases and patient's response to positive pressure ventilation are extremely important in critical care management. Upon completion of this activity, participants should be able to to briefly discuss how cytokines affect the lungs as a result of COVID-19 infection, to identify ventilator strategies and initial management of patients with ARDS, and to identify the common complications when ventilating patients with ARDS.",

    "abstract": "Bicinchoninic acid, sodium salt, is a stable, water-soluble compound capable of forming an intense purple complex with cuprous ion (Cu1+) in an alkaline environment. This reagent forms the basis of an analytical method capable of monitoring cuprous ion produced in the reaction of protein with alkaline Cu2+ (biuret reaction). The color produced from this reaction is stable and increases in a proportional fashion over a broad range of increasing protein concentrations. When compared to the method of Lowry et al., the results reported here demonstrate a greater tolerance of the bicinchoninate reagent toward such commonly encountered interferences as nonionic detergents and simple buffer salts. The stability of the reagent and resulting chromophore also allows for a simplified, one-step analysis and an enhanced flexibility in protocol selection. This new method maintains the high sensitivity and low protein-to-protein variation associated with the Lowry technique.",

    "abstract": "A reliable and reproducible method for the estimation of the protein content of fungal cells immobilized in a carrageenan gel is described. The procedure depends upon the acid lability of the polysaccharide gel at 90 degrees C and on the acetone solubility of accumulated phenolics. Freeze-dried gel beads (2-3 mm) containing entrapped cells of Penicillium urticae were ground to a fine powder and samples of powder (approximately 20 mg) were sequentially extracted with hot 1 N HCl - 0.9% NaCl and acetone. The precipitated residue contained the cell protein, which was then solubilized with 1 N NaOH at 90 degrees C and quantitated by the Folin-Lowry method. Interferences from both carrageenan and phenols were thus eliminated. The presence of carrageenan (20-25 mg) did not affect the recovery of varying amounts (0-2500 micrograms) of bovine serum albumin. The recovery of radiolabeled protein from immobilized cells was parallel to that of Folin-Lowry positive material over a range of 0-60 beads (0-60 mg powder). Cycloheximide (0-100 micrograms/mL) was shown to progressively inhibit the incorporation of L-[U-14C]leucine so that the radioactivity present in the initial HCl-NaCl extract (i.e., [14C]leucine) increased as that in the final NaOH extract (i.e., 14C-labeled protein) decreased. Using this new assay for cell protein, free and immobilized cell cultures were found to exhibit virtually identical kinetics of glucose utilization, growth, and patulin production. In addition to providing a means of comparing the specific productivity of free versus immobilized cell preparations, this assay accurately measures the incorporation of [14C]leucine into cellular protein and could be used as a measure of cell viability.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the application of 3-(4-carboxybenzoyl)quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde (CBQCA), a sensitive fluorogenic reagent for detection of amines, to the assay of proteins in solution. The sensitivity and dynamic range of CBQCA in the determination of protein concentration is modulated by the number of accessible amines present in the protein assayed. Thus, this method bears the same limitations as other reagents used in fluorogenic assays based on fluorescent amine adducts such as those obtained with fluorescamine or o-phthaldialdehyde, or of other spectrophotometric methods, where the color development is determined by the abundance in the protein of certain amino acids. However, in comparison to other fluorescence-based protein detection methods, CBQCA has proven to be an extremely sensitive reagent with a very broad, essentially linear dynamic range, capable of detecting from 10 ng to 150 micrograms of protein (in a 100- to 200-microL assay volume). The CBQCA reagent also functions well in the presence of substances, such as lipids, known to interfere in many other protein determination methods.",
